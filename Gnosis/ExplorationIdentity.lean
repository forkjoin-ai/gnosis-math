# The Exploration Identity: Skyrms - Optimal = Exploration

The simplest theorem in the paper. The gap between the globally optimal
assignment (unknown, undecidable) and the Skyrms Nash equilibrium
(known, computable) is exactly the exploration budget.

    Skyrms - Optimal = Exploration

This is not an inequality. It is an identity. The exploration is not
overhead. It is the distance between what you know and what you could
know. The God Gap applied to strategy selection.

The sliver is the mechanism. The void boundary is the measurement.
The oscillation is the dynamics. This identity is the accounting.
