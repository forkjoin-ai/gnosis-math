# Philosophical Combinatorics: New Theorems from Cross-Allegory Composition

Systematic pairwise composition of the philosophical allegory, Greek
logic, unsolved mystery, and second-tier mystery modules with each
other and with the core framework. Each composition produces a theorem
that NEITHER source module states alone.

/-- THEOREM: The sea battle prediction and the Socratic dialogue
    produce weights by the same mechanism. A failed battle prediction
    maps to a Socratic refutation. The future contingent is just a thesis
    that hasn't been refuted yet.

    converges geometrically (like Achilles). Each moral experience
    that "misses the mark" (hamartia) still closes the gap.

    Aristotle's Golden Mean + Zeno's Achilles = virtue is approached

    learn by the same mechanism: rejection. Each failed stone fit
    is a refutation. Each earthquake is a question. The void

/-- THEOREM: The arrow moves between instants (resolving Zeno)
    AND information is conserved through the trajectory (resolving
    Theseus). The arrow's identity is its trajectory — the void
