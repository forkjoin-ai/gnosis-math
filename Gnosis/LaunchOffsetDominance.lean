# Launch Offset Dominance: The Cost and Benefit of Sequenced Starts

The heterogeneous fabric's launch schedule computes a head start for
slower backends: `launchOffsetMs = targetArrivalMs - arrivalHorizonMs`.
The slowest backend launches first. The fastest launches last. The
target is simultaneous arrival.

This module is honest about both sides:

**The cost is real.** The offset delays the fast backend's launch.
That delay adds latency to every round where the fast backend would
have won without waiting. The penalty is exactly `offsetMs` of added
wall time per round in the worst case.

**The benefit is also real.** The slow backend occasionally completes,
enriching the community's void boundary with observations from a
different hardware layer. Richer void means better predictions, which
means fewer wasted hedges in future rounds, which reduces cumulative
waste.

**The threshold.** The offset is worth it when the cumulative
community learning benefit exceeds the cumulative fast-path delay
penalty. Below that threshold, the system should not give the head
start -- the slow backend is too slow to contribute enough
observations to justify the delay. Above it, the offset is a net
improvement.

This is the honest framing of affirmative action as a scheduling
policy: it penalizes the advantaged participant by a computed amount.
At some point the penalty is worth the community learning gain.
At some point it is not. The theory identifies both thresholds.

/-- The complete launch offset analysis.

    1. The penalty is real and bounded by the latency gap
    2. When diversity gain exceeds penalty, the offset is worth it
    3. When it does not, the offset is not worth it
    4. The offset self-eliminates when the gap closes

    This is the honest theorem: affirmative action has a real cost
    to the advantaged participant. The cost is worth paying when
    the diversity gain to the community exceeds it. The cost is
    not worth paying when it does not. The theory identifies both
    cases explicitly. -/
