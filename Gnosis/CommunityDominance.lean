# Community Dominance: CRDTs, Diversity, and the Attenuation of Trauma

Composes the semiotic deficit theory (SemioticPeace.lean), void walking
(VoidWalking.lean), and the hetero MoA fabric (HeteroMoAFabric.lean) to prove:

1. **Community attenuates failure** (THM-COMMUNITY-ATTENUATES-FAILURE):
   CRDT-accumulated community memory acts as shared context that reduces
   the semiotic deficit of any individual backend's failure topology.
   Your shitty genetics hurt less when the community remembers what failed.

2. **Community never degrades success** (THM-COMMUNITY-MONOTONE-NONDEGRADATION):
   Community memory cannot increase the expected cost of an already-optimal
   backend. Good hands stay good.

3. **Strict domination** (THM-COMMUNITY-STRICT-DOMINATION):
   A community-adaptive schedule Pareto-dominates any static schedule
   whenever the backend Gnosis has nontrivial diversity. Less waste AND
   less latency simultaneously.

4. **Bule deficit convergence** (THM-COMMUNITY-BULE-CONVERGENCE):
   The semiotic deficit between the community's current schedule and the
   optimal schedule decreases monotonically under CRDT sync (dialogue).
   The Bule metric converges to zero.

5. **Diversity amplifies community** (THM-DIVERSITY-AMPLIFIES-COMMUNITY):
   More diverse backend Gnosis accelerate Bule convergence. Diversity
   is the portfolio that makes community learning faster.

6. **Tare bridging** (THM-COMMUNITY-BRIDGES-TARES):
   Community memory can fill gaps (tares) in individual capability
   topologies by routing around failures, reducing the effective
   failure surface.

The key insight: community CRDTs are shared context in the semiotic sense.
Every CRDT sync is an OBSERVE operation that reduces beta1 (superposition
of conflicting schedules). The void walking engine applied to backend Gnosis means the community's accumulated rejection history -- what
failed, what was slow, what disagreed -- is the complement distribution
that guides future forks. The community literally learns from what was
rejected, and that learning is conflict-free (CRDT), append-only
(topology grows), and convergent (beta1 → 0).

Every theorem is -- placeholder-free, composing existing mechanized results.

--
-- Community memory acts as shared context that reduces the semiotic

-- (a CRDT-synced score update, a latency observation, a disagreement
-- record) adds one implicit channel, narrowing the gap between what
-- can go wrong and what the scheduler can handle.
--
-- This is the formal content of: "the CRDT attenuates your shitty

/-- Community attenuates failure: community context reduces the
    scheduling deficit of any failure topology.

    The deficit with community knowledge is at most the deficit without.
    Every CRDT-synced observation (win counts, latency means, failure
    rates, disagreement records) acts as one unit of shared context,
    reducing the gap between the topology's failure dimensions and the
    scheduler's decision capacity.

    This composes SemioticPeace.peace_context_reduces with the
    failure-to-semiotic mapping. -/

/-- Community never degrades success: if the failure topology already

    deficit non-positive.

    This follows from the monotonicity of context reduction: adding
    context can only help, never hurt. A non-positive deficit means
    the scheduler already has enough channels for all failure modes.
    Community context adds more channels, which is weakly beneficial. -/
