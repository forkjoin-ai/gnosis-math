Paper Classification: Paper-ready as stated

Queue containment is trivially transparent: when the supplied `β₁=0` queue law
holds, the framework recovers that one-path boundary, and when `β₁>0` the
framework exposes an additional topology-control witness. No changes needed.

Paper Classification: Conditional (standard measure-theoretic regularity)

The queue limit schema lifts finite-truncation conservation to the unbounded
limit under standard regularity conditions:
  - truncationsExhaustSupport — DCT/MCT exhaustion
  - monotoneSupportApproximation — monotone approximation
  - measurableCustomerTime / measurableSojournTime — measurability
  - integrableDominatingEnvelope — dominated convergence envelope

Paper states as: "Under standard regularity (measurability, dominated envelope,
support exhaustion), the finite-truncation conservation law lifts to the limit."

Paper Classification: Mostly constructive (7/10 discharged)

State-dependent queue stability schema. Of 10 total conditions:
  - 7 automatically discharged: irreducible (from bridge witness),
    fosterLyapunovDrift (from drift bound), petiteSet (from finite small set),
    positiveRecurrent (derived), stationaryLawExists (derived),
    queueBalance (derived), terminalBalance (derived with vanishing open age)
  - 3 user-supplied: explicit routing bridge, Lyapunov drift bound,
    and finite small set

Paper states as: "Given explicit routing bridge, Lyapunov drift bound, and
finite small set, the framework derives positive recurrence, stationary law
existence, and queue balance."

Paper Classification: Constructive synthesis

Adaptive supremum schema synthesizes drift witnesses automatically from raw
ceiling domination data. Five synthesis routes are supported:
  1. Minimum slack — `ofMinimumSlack`: bottleneck node identity
  2. Normalized scores — `ofNormalizedScoreSlack`: nonneg score family normalized
  3. Positive-part scores — `ofPositivePartScoreSlack`: clip then normalize
  4. Selected slack — `ofSelectedSlack`: one-hot selector decomposition
  5. Weighted slack — `ofNormalizedWeightedSlack`: weighted slack with
     pointwise node slack bounds

Paper states as: "Under adaptive ceiling domination, the drift witness is
synthesized automatically via one of five constructive routes."

Paper Classification: Partially constructive

`local_node_decomposition` (Claims.lean) discharges node classification
constructively: every finite DAG node classifies into {fork, join, chain}.
Remaining: full edge-coverage decomposition and encoding function existence
are assumption-parameterized.

Paper states as: "Every finite DAG node classifies into {fork, join, chain}
(constructive). Under (B1) decomposition existence, (B2) soundness/completeness,

Paper Classification: Conditional (7 physics axioms)

The convergence schema claims fork/race/fold is the unique attractor in a modeled
finite class. The 7 explicit assumptions are:
  (A1) conservesEnergy — energy conservation
  (A2) irreversibleTime — time irreversibility / second law
  (A3) nonzeroGroundOverhead — non-zero ground-state overhead
  (A4) finiteStateModel — finite-state model scope
  (A5) throughputSelectionPressure — throughput selection pressure
  (A6) forkRaceFoldAttractor — fork/race/fold is an attractor
  (A7) noAlternativeInModelClass — uniqueness in model class

Paper states as: "In any finite-state system satisfying (A1)-(A7), fork/race/fold
is the unique throughput-optimal attractor."
