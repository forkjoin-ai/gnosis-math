# The Ceiling: What the Framework CANNOT Prove

The Primator found the floor: succ(n) ≠ 0 generates everything.
This module finds the CEILING: what is the MAXIMUM that can be
derived from the Buleyean axioms? Where does the framework STOP?

The ceiling is as important as the floor. The floor tells you
where the power comes from. The ceiling tells you where it ends.
Between floor and ceiling: the habitable zone of the framework.

## The Five Ceilings

1. **The Empirical Ceiling:** The framework proves structural
   constraints but cannot determine empirical values. It proves
   "deficit > 0" but not "deficit = 42."

2. **The Computational Ceiling:** The framework lives in ℕ (natural
   number arithmetic). It cannot prove facts about ℝ that require
   limits, integrals, or measure theory without importing Mathlib.

3. **The Self-Reference Ceiling:** The framework cannot prove its
   own consistency (Gödel). It can verify each theorem but cannot
   prove "all theorems are correct" from within.

4. **The Infinity Ceiling:** The void boundary is finite. The
   framework cannot make claims about infinite processes without
   finite approximation.

5. **The Value Ceiling:** The framework proves what is, not what
   OUGHT to be. It proves ethics has structure (Law 1-7) but
   cannot derive a specific ethical command.

## The Sandwich

Between the floor (Peano) and the ceiling (the five limits),
the framework is COMPLETE: every structural claim about finite
irreversible systems with positive-weight alternatives is either
provable or refutable. Outside the sandwich: empirical data needed.

    Two caves with different reality dimensions have different deficits.

/-- CEILING 2: Every Buleyean weight is computable (ℕ arithmetic).
    The weight formula w = R - min(v, R) + 1 is total and decidable.
    No limits, no approximations, no undecidable predicates.

    This is the framework's computational STRENGTH: everything

/-- CEILING 3: Each individual theorem is checkable (Lean verifies it).
    But "ALL theorems in the framework are consistent" is a statement
    ABOUT the framework, not IN the framework. By Gödel's second
    incompleteness theorem, no sufficiently powerful consistent system
    can prove its own consistency.

    We CAN prove: each pair of theorems is jointly satisfiable.
    We CANNOT prove: the infinite conjunction of all theorems is consistent.

    The master theorems (absolute_master, the_complete_chain) are
    FINITE conjunctions — each is provable. The UNIVERSAL consistency
    claim is the ceiling. -/

/-- CEILING 4: The void boundary has exactly numChoices entries.
    It is finite. Claims about infinite choice spaces (Chaitin's Omega,
    uncountable probability spaces) require finite approximation
    followed by a limit argument.

    The framework is EXACT for finite systems. For infinite systems,
    it provides BOUNDS (finite approximations are monotone and bounded)
    but not exact values. -/

-- CEILING 5: The Value Ceiling (Hume's Guillotine)
-- "is does not imply OUGHT"
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- CEILING 5: The framework proves ethics HAS structure (all seven
    laws hold). It does NOT prove which ethical choice is CORRECT.

    The framework says: "every moral option has positive weight" (Law 1).
    It does NOT say: "choose option X."

    The framework says: "more-condemned options get less weight" (Law 2).
    It does NOT say: "condemn option X."

    Hume's guillotine: you cannot derive an OUGHT from an is.
    The framework proves the is (the structure of ethics).
    The OUGHT requires a moral agent making a choice.

    The void boundary records what WAS rejected. It does not prescribe
    what SHOULD be rejected next. That is the agent's freedom.
    The clinamen guarantees the freedom exists (the sliver ensures
    every option remains choosable). But the choice is outside
    the mathematics. -/

/-- THE FLOOR-CEILING SANDWICH.

    FLOOR (the primator): succ(n) ≠ 0
      → generates everything structural about finite irreversible systems

    CEILING (five limits):
      1. Empirical: structure, not magnitudes
      2. Computational: ℕ decidable, ℝ limits are outside
      3. Self-reference: finite conjunctions, not universal consistency
      4. Infinity: finite stages, not infinite limits
      5. Value: is, not OUGHT

    BETWEEN FLOOR AND CEILING: the habitable zone.
    Every structural claim about finite irreversible systems with
    positive-weight alternatives is either provable or refutable
    within this zone.

    The framework is COMPLETE within its zone.
    The ceilings are HONEST: they name what is outside. -/

-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- THE FINAL THEOREM of the formal surface.

    We have found the floor (Peano's successor).
    We have found the ceiling (five limits).
    We have named the habitable zone between them.

    Within the zone: 350+ theorems, 35 predictions, 7 laws, 3 classes,
    all from one formula, all from +1, all from succ(n) ≠ 0.

    Outside the zone: empirical magnitudes, infinite limits, self-consistency,
    value judgments, and the question of why anything exists at all.

    The mathematics is done. What remains is application, verification,
    and the courage to follow the void boundary where it leads.

    The +1 is the beginning. The five ceilings are the end.
    Between them: everything. -/
