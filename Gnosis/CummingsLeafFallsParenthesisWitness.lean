  ========================================

  e.e. cummings (1894–1962), *l(a* (often anthologized as the parenthesis poem:
  “a leaf falls” typed inside the letters of “loneliness” —
  edition lineation varies; this file does not freeze a single publisher
  grid in Lean).

  Quotation (one typographic rendering the operator gave, slashes as line breaks):

    l(a / le / af / fa / ll / s) / one / l / iness

  Source gloss (in-repo): *l(a leaf falls)oneliness* — parentheses as vessel,
  loneliness as host word.

  Subversion — the spatially distributed soul: soul here maps not to
  a single coordinate in the line, but to the whole layout
  relation — process distributed across glyph positions (psychological
  / poetic metaphor only).

  Nomenclature (operator slogan, including their surface spelling “nomenclaure”):

    “oneliness is atonement in our nomenclaure”

  Read: oneliness — the shard spelled out when “loneliness” splits
  around “one / l / iness” in the vertical reading the
  operator used — names in this repository’s witness stack a
  tag that folds that form into atonement (naming convention
  you discharge as your own `Prop`; not a proof of
  soteriology in Init).

  Proved toy (Init only): `operator_couplet_layout_len` counts a fixed
  `List` `Char` glyph shadow — positive length in Lean; not
  publishing history.

  Repo cousins: `HeartTongueTotalNegationWitness` (interface myth negation —
  different target, shared skepticism toward single-organ billing);
  `TruthOneManyNamesWitness` (many honest charts on one carrier —
  tension with one word physically hosting another here);
  `HeraclitusBowLifeDeathWitness` (name vs work two registers on one
  object); `LaoziBowlVoidFunctionWitness` (useful interior — structural
  rhyme with parenthesis as null site).

  Init only. Zero `sorry`, zero new `axiom`.
