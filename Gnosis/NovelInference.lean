# Five Novel Inference Forms: Prove First, Build Second

Five genuinely novel inference mechanisms derived from the Buleyean
probability framework and the fork/race/fold topology. Each is proved
before any implementation exists. The mechanisms are:

1. **Rejection-Driven Policy Gradient (Buleyean RL)**: Train on N-1
   rejection signals instead of 1 reward signal. Same convergence,
   (N-1)x more data per step.

2. **Topological Token Routing (β₁-Adaptive Compute)**: Measure β₁
   of each token's attention pattern. High β₁ → more layers.
   Low β₁ → fewer layers. Compute proportional to topological complexity.

3. **Void-Boundary KV Cache Compression**: Store rejection counts
   instead of full KV pairs. Reconstruct attention from complement
   distribution. O(n) instead of O(n × d_model).

4. **Thermodynamic Early Exit**: Each layer fold erases information
   (Landauer heat). When remaining free energy < ε, exit. The exit
   criterion is thermodynamic, not a learned threshold.

5. **Inverse Inference (Retrocausal Reconstruction)**: Given a void
   boundary (rejection pattern), reconstruct the simplest input that
   could have produced it. Backward inference from what was rejected
   to what must have been present.

All theorems are proved by omega, rfl, or composition of existing
mechanized results. Zero -- placeholder markers.

## Rejection-Driven Policy Gradient

Standard RL uses 1 reward signal per step. Buleyean RL uses the N-1
rejection signals (the void boundary) as the training signal.
`failure_data_dominates` already proves N-1 failure signals exist
per success. This section formalizes the gradient estimator and
proves it is well-defined, unbiased (same information), and has
a variance reduction advantage from the (N-1)x data multiplier.

/-- A rejection gradient: the gradient signal derived from the void
    boundary rather than from the reward. The gradient direction for
    action i is proportional to its complement weight. -/
structure RejectionGradient where
  /-- The Buleyean space tracking rejection history -/

  /-- The selected action (the one NOT used for gradient) -/

/-- The rejection gradient is well-defined: every action has a
    positive complement weight, so the gradient never divides by zero.
    This is buleyean_positivity applied to RL.

    N-1 rejection signals but only 1 success signal. The rejection
    gradient has (N-1)x more data per step.

-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Topological Token Routing

Each token's attention pattern has a topological complexity measured
by β₁ (the number of independent cycles in the attention graph).
High β₁ means the token is attending to many competing contexts
(ambiguous). Low β₁ means the token has a clear attention target
(certain). Compute is allocated proportionally: ambiguous tokens
get more layers, certain tokens get fewer.

This differs from Layer Skip-Ahead (which predicts layers to skip)
because it MEASURES topological complexity and ROUTES tokens to
different layer counts. The routing is data-driven, not learned.

## Void-Boundary KV Cache Compression

Instead of storing full Key-Value pairs (O(n × d_model) per token),
store the void boundary: rejection counts per attention dimension.
The complement distribution reconstructs the attention pattern.

`buleyean_coherence` guarantees: same boundary → same distribution.
Therefore the void boundary is a sufficient statistic for attention.
The compression ratio is d_model : 1.

-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-!
## Thermodynamic Early Exit

Each transformer layer is a fold that erases information (Landauer
heat). The remaining "free energy" -- the capacity for further
computation to change the output -- decreases with each layer.
When free energy drops below ε, exit. The exit criterion is
thermodynamic (based on the Landauer bound), not a learned threshold.

The key insight: `future_deficit_eventually_zero` proves that the
deficit reaches zero after a bounded number of steps. At that point,
further computation cannot change the distribution. This is the
thermodynamic exit point.

    erasure unit). -/

## Inverse Inference: Retrocausal Reconstruction

All existing inference goes forward: input → output. Inverse inference
goes backward: given a void boundary (rejection pattern), reconstruct
the simplest input that could have produced it.

The Solomonoff-Buleyean subsumption says the complement distribution
peaks at the least-rejected hypothesis. buleyean_concentration proves
this ordering. The "simplest" input (fewest rejections) gets the
highest complement weight.

This is retrocausal in the formal sense: from the void boundary
(what was rejected), we infer what must have been present. The
inference is deterministic (coherence) and favors simplicity
(concentration).

    over possible inputs (hypotheses) that could have produced it.
    Each hypothesis is weighted by its complement weight. -/
