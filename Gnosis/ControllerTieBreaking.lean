# Controller Tie Breaking

The existing controller theorems prove strict optimality and score minimality.
This module closes the exact-equality boundary induced by the branch order in
`chooseFailureAction` and `chooseWarmupAction`.

The new surface is intentionally explicit:

- any failure-controller tie involving `keepMultiplicity` resolves to `keepMultiplicity`
- a failure-controller `payVent`/`payRepair` tie resolves to `payVent`
- an underfilled warm-up state at the exact redline resolves to `expand`
- an overfilled warm-up state at the exact redline resolves to `constrain`

The anti-theorems record the corresponding non-selections.
