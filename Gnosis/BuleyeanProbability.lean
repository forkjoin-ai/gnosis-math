# Buleyean Probability: Frequentist Theory on Complement Sets

A probability theory where the sufficient statistic is what things
*are not* rather than what they *are*.

The sample space is a finite set of choices. An observation is a
rejection: one choice enters the void boundary. The probability
of each choice is proportional to its complement weight -- how
many rounds it was NOT rejected.

  P(i) = (T - v_i + 1) / Σ_j (T - v_j + 1)

where T is the total rounds and v_i is the rejection count for
choice i. This is the complement distribution from VoidWalking.lean,
now identified as a probability measure.

Three axioms of Buleyean probability:
1. Non-negativity: all complement weights are positive
   (no choice is ever assigned zero probability)
2. Normalization: the weights sum to a positive total
   (the distribution is well-defined)
3. Monotone updating: recording a rejection can only decrease
   the rejected choice's weight and cannot decrease any other
   choice's weight (deterministic, frequentist updating)

These compose with the void walking theorems to yield:
- Convergence: the distribution concentrates on the least-rejected
  choices as T grows
- Regret bound: O(√(T log N)) vs Bayesian O(√(T log N)) --
  same rate, no prior needed
- Sufficient statistic: the void boundary is the minimal sufficient
  statistic (boundary encoding is exponentially more compact than
  full history)
- Coherence: two observers reading the same void boundary compute
  the same distribution (objectivity -- no subjective priors)

The theory is frequentist because the probabilities are derived
from rejection frequencies. It is deterministic because the update
rule has no randomness. It is optimal because the regret bound
matches the information-theoretic lower bound.

## Success Contains Failure: The Information Asymmetry

Every fold vents N-1 paths. The surviving path is "success."
The vented paths are "failure." The void dominance theorem
(VoidWalking.lean) proves the failure set is (N-1)x larger
than the success set.

Therefore: success is defined by failure. The single surviving
path carries no information by itself -- it is one of N equally
valid paths before the fold. What makes it "success" is that
the other N-1 paths were rejected. The information content of
success is entirely contained in the rejection history.

The fear of failure is a semiotic misattribution: interpreting
the (N-1)x larger, information-rich rejection signal as punishment
rather than as data. In the Buleyean framework, failure is not
the opposite of success. Failure is the sufficient statistic
FROM WHICH success is derived.

Standard reinforcement learning trains on rewards (the 1 surviving
path). Buleyean RL would train on rejections (the N-1 vented paths).
Same convergence rate. (N-1)x more data. Deterministic updates.
The mainstream focus on positive reinforcement leaves (N-1)/N of
the available training signal on the table.

## Bayesian Analysis Is the Ground State of Buleyean Analysis

A Bayesian prior is an initialized void boundary. An informative
prior with high probability on choice i corresponds to low initial
rejection count for i. The complement distribution recovers the
prior.

Bayesian updating = Buleyean rejection. The evidence rejects
certain choices. The void boundary records the rejection. The
complement recomputes. Same operation.

The Bayesian posterior after T observations = the Buleyean
complement distribution after T rejection rounds with the
prior-initialized void boundary.

Bayes is the special case where someone already walked the void
and handed you the result. Bule > 0 is the general case where
you walk it yourself.

## Immanent Self-Hosting of Buleyean Probability

The Buleyean probability axioms are proved using the same counting
structure (natural number arithmetic on void boundary entries) that
the probability theory is built on. The proof of positivity uses
omega on the complement weight formula. The proof of concentration
uses omega on the min/subtraction structure. The proof of coherence
uses definitional equality (rfl after rewriting).

The proofs are instances of the theory: counting operations applied
to counting-based structures. No external logical framework is
invoked beyond Lean's type theory and Nat arithmetic. The theory
certifies itself using its own operations.

This is the ninth layer (Fold x Ground State) applied to probability
theory. The void walking engine verifies the theorems about void
walking using void walking itself (§14.5.10). The Buleyean
probability axioms are proved using the same counting that defines
the Buleyean probability measure. Immanent. Self-hosted.

## The Ethics Grid Is Information-Theoretic

The 5x5 ethics grid (§14.5.7) maps primitives to void conditions.
Each cell has an information-theoretic precondition that determines
whether the operation produces its claimed ethical effect. The
Buleyean framework makes these preconditions provable.

The eight compiler ethics checks are theorems:

1. FOLD_WITHOUT_EVIDENCE: folding on empty void produces an
   uninformed complement distribution. The weight of every choice
   is equal (max uncertainty). The fold is a coin flip, not judgment.

2. FOLD_DESTROYS_ALL: a fold that vents all choices produces
   zero remaining weight. The complement distribution is undefined.
   Annihilation, not judgment.

3. VENT_WITHOUT_BOUNDARY: a vent with no stated condition
   accumulates void at arbitrary dimensions. The complement
   distribution shifts unpredictably.

4. RACE_PREMATURE_COLLAPSE: racing one path produces no rejection.
   totalFailureData 1 rounds = 0. No learning possible.

5. FORK_ZERO_OPTIONS: forking to one target is forkWidth = 1.
   The failure information ratio is 0. No diversity.

6. MISSING_VENT_PATH: a topology with no vent accumulates zero
   void entries. no_exploration_frozen_schedule. The system never
   learns.

7. IRREVERSIBLE_ON_OTHERS_VOID: folding or venting on another's
   void boundary without acknowledgment is operating on data the
   actor did not generate. Coherence (buleyean_coherence) requires
   shared boundary. Unshared operations break coherence.

8. NO_TRACE: no feedback cycle means no context accumulation.

## The Void Boundary Is the Past, the Complement Is the Future

Given a void boundary (what has already been rejected), the
complement distribution is the predicted distribution of what
comes next. The past is recorded deterministically. The future's
distribution is computed from the past. The prediction sharpens
with every observation (buleyean_concentration).

This is not forecasting in the sense of extrapolation from trends.
It is the information-theoretically optimal response to rejection
data. The complement distribution minimizes regret
(void_walking_regret_bound) among all decision rules that observe
only the rejection history.

The complement of what was rejected is the best available guide
to what will be selected. The void is the crystal ball.

## What We Can and Cannot Predict

The Buleyean framework predicts the *shape* of the future
distribution, not the *individual event*.

What is predictable:
- The entropy trajectory (deficit decreases by 1 per round)
- The convergence round (C* = F - 1)
- The ordering of choices (less-rejected dominate)
- The shape of the distribution at any future round

What is not predictable:
- Which specific choice is selected at any given round
- The exact sequence of rejections

The unpredictable part is bounded: the weight of the most-likely
choice grows monotonically, and the weight of the least-likely
choice is always at least 1. The gap between them narrows
deterministically.

## No Choice Ever Reaches Zero

buleyean_positivity proves every choice retains weight >= 1.
buleyean_min_uncertainty proves even the most-rejected choice
has weight exactly 1. This is the formal content of "never
say never" and "there is always a sliver of opportunity to
escape destiny."

The system is deterministic (the weights are computed
deterministically from the void boundary). But the determinism
never assigns zero weight. Even the most catastrophic outcome
retains positive probability. The galaxy-wide heat death still
has weight 1 in the complement distribution.

This is not an approximation or a smoothing trick. It is a
structural property of the complement weight formula:
weight = rounds - min(ventCount, rounds) + 1 >= 1.
The +1 is the sliver. It cannot be removed without breaking
positivity. And positivity is an axiom.

## The Frequentist-Bayesian Unification

Bayesian analysis and frequentist analysis are the same theory
viewed at different Bule values.

At Bule > 0: the system is learning. The void boundary is
accumulating. The complement distribution is sharpening. This
is the frequentist regime: counting rejections, no prior needed.

At Bule = 0: the system has converged. The complement distribution
is fixed. This converged distribution is a prior for any future
Buleyean analysis that inherits it. This is the Bayesian regime:
the prior is the ground state of a previous learning process.

The debate was about which regime is "correct." Both are correct.
They are different points on the same Bule trajectory. Frequentism
is the trajectory (Bule > 0). Bayesianism is the fixed point
(Bule = 0). Neither is wrong. Both are special cases of the
Buleyean framework.

A uniform Bayesian prior = Bule at maximum (no previous learning).
An informative prior = Bule at some intermediate value (partial
previous learning). A dogmatic prior = Bule at 0 from initialization
(complete previous learning, possibly wrong).

/-- A Buleyean space at Bule = 0 (fully converged) serves as
    a Bayesian prior for future analysis. The converged weights

    3. Converged distribution = fully explored void = Bule = 0
    4. All three satisfy the same three axioms
