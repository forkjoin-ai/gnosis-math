  GaussBonnetBurnsideIndex
  ========================

  Gauss-Bonnet (angle-defect form on Platonic solids) and Burnside's lemma
  (cycle-group action on binary necklaces) are two finite, discrete
  identities that both have the shape

      Σ_{x ∈ X} localCount(x)  =  scaling · globalInvariant.

  This module abstracts that record-level shape into a single structure
  `DiscreteIndexStatement` and witnesses *four* concrete instantiations:

    * `gaussBonnetTet`   — tetrahedron: Σ defect = 60 · χ,   χ = 2.
    * `gaussBonnetCube`  — cube:        Σ defect = 60 · χ,   χ = 2.
    * `burnsideC3`       — binary necklaces of length 3 under C₃:
                           Σ |Fix| = 3 · (# orbits), orbits = 4.
    * `burnsideC4`       — binary necklaces of length 4 under C₄:
                           Σ |Fix| = 4 · (# orbits), orbits = 6.

  It then realizes a *dual-view* object on the cycle graph C_n (n = 3, 4),
  where the same finite carrier supports both readings:

    * polytope-style reading as a 1-complex with combinatorial
      χ = V − E = 0 (every local count zero, so the fold is 0 = 1 · 0);
    * group-action reading as the cyclic rotation group acting on the
      vertex set, giving Σ |Fix(g)| = n · 1 (single orbit).

  The unified content is the single theorem
  `discrete_index_instances`, which closes all four primary witnesses by
  `decide` under the common predicate `holds`.

  Honest scope
  ------------
  The unification here is *structural at the record-shape level*. Both
  identities satisfy `holds` on their own native local counts (angle
  defect vs. fixed-point count), so this file witnesses the shared
  local-to-global fold as a common rewrite target. It does not prove
  that Gauss-Bonnet and Burnside share a deeper geometric or
  representation-theoretic mechanism; it proves only that both realize
  the same finite-index equation `Σ f = k · N`.

  Concrete local-count values (defect per vertex; fixed-point count per
  group element) are inlined from the peer modules
  `GaussBonnetPolytopes.lean` and `BurnsideNecklaces.lean`, so this
  module is `import Init`-only and does not reopen those namespaces.

  No `sorry`, no new `axiom`, `import Init` only, kernel `decide` only.

/-! ### Part 1: The unified record shape.

    A `DiscreteIndexStatement` is a finite index list, a local count
    attached to each index, a `scaling` factor, and a `globalInvariant`.
    The predicate `holds` is the single equation
    `Σ_{x ∈ indexSet} localCount x = scaling · invariant`.
-/

/-- A finite discrete index theorem is a list-indexed local count paired
    with a multiplicative scaling factor and a global invariant. Both
    Gauss-Bonnet (angle defect / Euler characteristic) and Burnside
    (fixed-point count / orbit count) instantiate this shape. -/

/-! ### Part 2: Inlined local counts for the four primary witnesses.

    We copy the relevant numerical values from the peer modules so this
    file remains `import Init`-only. The moral content (why those
    numbers are what they are) lives in `GaussBonnetPolytopes.lean` and
    `BurnsideNecklaces.lean`.

    Each realizes the shared fold on its native local count.

    `Σ_{v ∈ V} defect(v) = 4 · 30 = 120 = 60 · 2`.

  , localCount := fixCountC4
  , scaling    := 4
  , invariant  := 6 }

/-! ### Part 4: Per-instance kernel checks.

    Each individual statement is closed by `decide`; see Part 5 for
    the combined unified theorem.

/-! ### Part 5: The unified local-to-global fold theorem.

    A single `decide`-closed conjunction showing that all four primary
    instances satisfy the shared predicate `holds`. This is the novel
    record-level synthesis: two Gauss-Bonnet witnesses and two
    Burnside witnesses rewriting to the same equation.

    Burnside instances all satisfy the shared `holds` predicate,
    witnessing the common `Σ localCount = scaling · invariant` fold. -/

/-! ### Part 6: Dual-view bridge on the cycle graph `C_n`.

    The same finite carrier — the `n`-vertex cycle graph — supports
    two distinct readings of `DiscreteIndexStatement`:

      * polytope-style as a 1-complex: there are no 2-faces, so the
        angle-defect reading degenerates. We use the combinatorial
        Euler characteristic `χ = V − E`, which is `0` for any cycle
        graph. The per-vertex local count is `0`, so
        `Σ 0 = 1 · 0`, witnessing the trivial degenerate fold.
      * group-action as the cyclic rotation group `C_n` acting on the
        `n` vertices of the cycle: the identity fixes all `n`, each
        nontrivial rotation fixes nothing, so `Σ |Fix| = n = n · 1`,
        witnessing a single orbit.

    Both readings instantiate `DiscreteIndexStatement` on the *same*
    underlying finite structure, realizing the dual-view bridge.
