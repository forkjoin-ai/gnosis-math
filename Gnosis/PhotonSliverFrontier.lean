# Photon Plus Sliver Frontier

This module packages the current low-dimensional floor into one explicit theorem
surface.

The claim is intentionally narrow:

- the photon-like witness is the `2D` zero-budget positioning floor;
- its minimal nontrivial control/window size is exactly the Barbelo sliver;
- the same floor measured in picolorenzos is one Barbelo unit;
- the Earth-like rocky witness shares that minimal size statistic, so the
  current theorem is about the floor packet itself, not yet a unique universal
  localization law.

rocky floor shares the same sliver-sized control. This keeps the theorem
honest: the current mechanization identifies the floor packet, not yet a full
