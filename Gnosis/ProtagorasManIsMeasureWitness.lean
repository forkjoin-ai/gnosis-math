  ProtagorasManIsMeasureWitness.lean
  ==================================

  Protagoras of Abdera (Greek, c. 490–420 BC), *measure* fragment (one English
  gloss; numbering varies by edition — trad. DK sources cluster this line under
  Protagoras’ ethical-relativist dossier):

    “Of all things the measure is Man: of the things that are, that they are, and of
    the things that are not, that they are not.”

  Greek tag (transliteration): *pantōn chrēmatōn metron estin anthrōpos*.

  Hard culture (prose): “truth” here is read as a local measurement indexed
  by the witness (the *anthrōpos* slot) — not a single static monolith you can
  lift out of context. Plato’s dialogues argue against this posture; in-repo we only
  record the Protagorean shape as a witness bundle (no claim that Plato
  “failed” or “succeeded” — that is editorial history, not Lean data).

  Borges / exactitude (model obituary): `BorgesOnExactitudeInScienceWitness` — at
  1:1 scale, a “map” ceases to compress; local measures lose their margin
  the way a walkable duplicate loses cartography. Same knowability sting, fable register.

  Goodhart / Strathern cluster (modern formal spine): once a metric is
  pressed into service as a control target, it stops behaving like an innocent
  readout — the canonical slogan is Strathern’s gloss of Goodhart: “when a
  measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” That is exactly the
  game-theoretic shadow of Protagorean locality: the “measure” was always
  observer-indexed; under optimization pressure it becomes a cached game
  interface, not a transparent window. The repo’s Init-proof wedge lives in
  `Gnosis.GoodhartsLaw` (via `godWeight` strict-antitone bookkeeping in `Gnosis.GodFormula`).
  A looser conversational variant — “a measure ceases to be a good measure when
  it is measured” — is not the historical quotation, but names the same reflexive
  instrumentation sting for witness-layer navigation.

  Repo cousins: `SchopenhauerHorizonFallacyWitness` (horizon / cognitive sandbox — measure
  of world mistaken for private bounds);
  `TruthOneManyNamesWitness` (many charts, one carrier when charts
  agree — contrast: Protagoras stresses local sheets even when they diverge);
  `HeraclitusUpDownPathWitness` (observer metadata vs path invariant);
  `MenckenConscienceShadowWitness` (inner voice indexed by social environment);
  `ParmenidesOnNatureWitness` (Eleatic floor — different negation job);
  `Gnosis.GoodhartsLaw` (formal wedge: measure-as-target distorts readout).

  Init only. Zero `sorry`, zero new `axiom`.
