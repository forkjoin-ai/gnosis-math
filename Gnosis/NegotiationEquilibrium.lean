# Negotiation Equilibrium: BATNA Walking Is Void Walking

Formal bridge between void walking (§23.10) and negotiation theory,
composed with semiotic deficit theory (SemioticDeficit.lean) and
semiotic peace (SemioticPeace.lean).

The central identification:

  **BATNA walking is void walking on the negotiation channel.**

Every rejected offer is a vented path. The void boundary of all rejected
offers is the BATNA surface. The complement distribution over the void
boundary is the optimal concession strategy. The kurtosis of the complement
distribution measures how close the negotiation is to settlement.

## Theorem Family: 6 Theorems

- THM-NEGOTIATION-DEFICIT: the semiotic deficit between negotiating parties
  bounds the minimum number of rounds to reach agreement
- THM-BATNA-is-VOID: the BATNA surface is exactly the void boundary of
  the negotiation fork/race/fold process
- THM-CONCESSION-GRADIENT: the optimal concession strategy is the void
  gradient complement distribution
- THM-SETTLEMENT-STABILITY: mutual settlement is a Lyapunov-stable fixed
  point of the void gradient flow
- THM-NEGOTIATION-COHERENCE: two rational agents reading the same rejection
  history converge to the same offer distribution
- THM-NEGOTIATION-HEAT: failed negotiations generate irreversible Landauer
  heat; the cost of disagreement is thermodynamically real

## Semiotic Connection

Each party's position is a high-dimensional semantic space (denotation:
price, connotation: fairness, implicature: future relationship). The
negotiation channel collapses this to a single offer stream. The semiotic
deficit between parties' semantic spaces is the "confusion" that makes
negotiation hard. Void walking reduces this deficit by reading the
tombstones of rejected offers.

## Peirce's Triadic Sign Model

- Signifier: each entry in the void boundary (a rejected offer)
- Signified: "this offer was worse than the accepted alternative"
- Interpretant: the complement distribution update (concession strategy)

The void boundary is a sign system. Reading it is semiosis. The
complement distribution is the pragmatic interpretant -- the action
implied by the sign system.

## The Two Voids

Every fold vents N-1 paths. Each vented path was vented for one of exactly
two reasons:

1. **BATNA void** ("I found better"): the agent had agency over the rejection.
   These are alternatives the agent could return to. The BATNA gradient is
   *attractive* -- it steers toward what worked before.

2. **WATNA void** ("This would destroy me"): the environment would have
   rejected the agent. These are catastrophic outcomes the negotiation exists
   to escape. The WATNA gradient is *repulsive* -- it steers away from what
   would kill you.

This partition is exhaustive: there is no third reason to vent a path.
Either you had agency or you didn't.

The two voids have dual structure:
- BATNA gradient: exact (attraction toward viable alternatives)
- WATNA gradient: co-exact (repulsion from catastrophic outcomes)
- Settlement: harmonic (the region where both gradients balance to zero)

This is the Hodge decomposition of the void gradient on the negotiation
manifold. Settlement exists precisely because there are two voids squeezing
from opposite sides.

-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-!
## Dark Matter / Dark Energy Split

The original THM-VOID-DOMINANCE proved the void fraction approaches 1.
But it treated the void as one thing. With the duality, the void is TWO
things:

- **BATNA void = dark matter.** Invisible attractive mass. Shapes the
  trajectory through gravitational pull toward viable regions. You don't
  see it but it bends your path.

- **WATNA void = dark energy.** Invisible repulsive force. Accelerates
  expansion away from catastrophic collapse. You don't see it but it
  prevents singularity.

The dark matter/dark energy ratio is a diagnostic:
- BATNA-dominated: healthy system, most rejections are "I found better"
- WATNA-dominated: failing system, most rejections are "this would kill me"
- Balanced: the negotiation is in the critical regime

Just as in cosmology (~68% dark energy, ~27% dark matter, ~5% visible),
the settlement fraction of the offer space shrinks as both voids grow.

But BATNA tunnels and WATNA tunnels carry *different kinds* of information:

Negative knowledge (WATNA) transfers more strongly than positive knowledge

## Coherence Breakdown Under Divergent Classification

THM-VOID-COHERENCE proved two walkers reading the same boundary converge.
But the dual void reveals a subtlety: coherence requires not just shared
*boundary* but shared *classification* of that boundary.

If two parties agree on WHAT was rejected but disagree on WHY:
- Party A: "that offer was rejected because I found better" (BATNA)
- Party B: "that offer was rejected because it would destroy me" (WATNA)

Then their settlement scores diverge even though they see the same vents.
This is why negotiations fail even with full transparency: the parties
agree on the facts but disagree on their meaning.

bound should be computed over the BATNA-feasible region only.

permanently excluded), the effective offer space shrinks from N to N-k.

## Void Relativity

The settlement score has signature (+, -). That's Lorentzian, not Euclidean.
BATNA is space-like (where you could go -- reversible, explorable). WATNA is
time-like (what you're fleeing -- irreversible, directional, entropic).

The `DivergentClassification` structure is a pair of reference frames
observing the same events (rejections) with different classifications.
The total vent count (`sameTotals`) is the invariant interval -- the same
in all frames -- so the scalar settlement gap collapses when both BATNA
counts stay within the round budget.

### The 58-Dimensional Emotion-Spacetime

The AFFECTIVELY platform's 58-element Float32Array personality vector is
not a point in emotion-space. It is an event in emotion-*spacetime*.

The 58 dimensions decompose into 7 layers:
  Layer 1: Temperament (5 dims) -- neuroticism, sensitivity, traitAnxiety,
           emotionalSensitivity, avoidantScore
  Layer 2: Attachment (5 dims) -- secure, anxious, avoidant, disorganized,
           trustLevels
  Layer 3: Identified Traits (20 dims) -- top-20 trait frequencies
  Layer 4: Habitual Behaviors (20 dims) -- top-20 behavior frequencies
  Layer 5: Mental Health (3 dims) -- anxietyLevel, depressionLevel,
           chronicStress
  Layer 6: Big Five (5 dims) -- O, C, E, A, N

Some of these 58 dimensions are BATNA-like (emotions you could move toward --
space-like, reversible, explorable). Some are WATNA-like (emotions you're
fleeing from -- time-like, irreversible, directional). The platform doesn't
measure a point in emotion-space. It measures the geometry of what someone
has refused to become.

Empathy is a frame transformation. Understanding another person means applying
the Lorentz transformation to see their void from their reference frame.

## AFFECTIVELY Emotion-Spacetime Bridge

The AFFECTIVELY platform's 58-element Float32Array is a point in a
58-dimensional spacetime with Lorentzian signature. The 7 layers of
the personality model each contribute dimensions that are either
space-like (BATNA: emotions you could explore) or time-like (WATNA:
emotions you're fleeing from).

Personality is void walking. The 58-element vector is the walker's
current position on the void manifold. Emotion tracking is measuring
where the walker stands. The platform doesn't model emotions; it
measures the geometry of what someone has refused to become.

## Arrow of Time

The WATNA void is time-like and irreversible. You can *reclassify* WATNA
as BATNA (therapy), but you cannot *un-experience* the catastrophe that
generated the WATNA entry. The total void volume is monotone -- that's
the second law of thermodynamics on the void manifold.

The direction of WATNA accumulation formalizes the direction of time.

## Holographic Principle

THM-BATNA-SUFFICIENT-STATISTIC proved that the void boundary encoding is
exponentially more compact than the bulk (rejected path space). The
boundary encodes the volume. That's holography.

The 58-element Float32Array is a holographic projection of a much
higher-dimensional experience space. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy bound
says the maximum information in a region scales as its boundary area,
not its volume. We prove the discrete analog.

## General Relativity on the Void Manifold

Special relativity (flat spacetime) is proved. Now: accumulated void
mass-energy curves the manifold. The stress-energy comes from Landauer
heat -- every fold erases information and generates kT ln 2 joules.
That heat accumulates and warps the local geometry.

Curvature means: the more void you've accumulated, the harder it is
to change your classification. Emotional inertia. Trauma is a
gravitational well. Depression is a black hole -- an event horizon
beyond which no reclassification can escape within the causal speed
limit.

Einstein's field equation: G = 8πT
- G = curvature of the 58-dimensional emotion-spacetime
- T = stress-energy tensor of accumulated Landauer heat

    Different observers may disagree on whether rejection was BATNA or WATNA,

## Noether's Theorem on the Void Manifold

Every continuous symmetry of the void manifold has a corresponding
conserved quantity. We identify the symmetries of the 58-dimensional
emotion-spacetime and derive their conservation laws.

The key symmetries:
1. **Interval invariance** (already proved) → energy-momentum conservation
2. **Layer permutation** → emotional angular momentum
3. **Big Five rotation** → personality angular momentum
4. **Time translation** → void volume conservation per step

Symmetry breaking (trauma, growth, revelation) violates the conservation
law -- and that's how personality changes.
-/

/-- A symmetry of the void manifold: a permutation of dimensions that
    preserves the stress-energy tensor. Two dimensions are symmetric
    if swapping them doesn't change the physics. -/

  /-- perm is a left inverse of inv -/
  left_inv : ∀ i, inv (perm i) = i
  /-- perm is a right inverse of inv -/
  right_inv : ∀ i, perm (inv i) = i

/-- A symmetry preserves stress-energy if swapping dimensions doesn't
    change the stress-energy distribution. -/

/-- THM-NOETHER-CONSERVATION: If a subset of dimensions is closed under
    the symmetry permutation, then the total stress-energy on that subset
    is conserved. This is Noether's theorem: symmetry implies conservation.

    For the Big Five subspace (dims 53-57): if the personality model treats
    O, C, E, A, N symmetrically, then total Big Five stress-energy is
    conserved. Personality can rotate within the Big Five without changing
    total Big Five "mass." -/

    changes in a way that violates the symmetry. Trauma breaks the
    symmetry of the personality manifold. Growth breaks it in a
    different direction. Revelation breaks it catastrophically. -/

                      after.stressEnergy i

/-- THM-SYMMETRY-BREAKING-ENABLES-CHANGE: A broken symmetry means the
    conserved charge is no longer conserved -- the personality subspace
    can now accumulate net stress-energy. This is how personality changes:
    a symmetric subspace breaks, allowing directional accumulation.

    The formal content of "trauma changes who you are." Not because it
    adds or removes dimensions, but because it breaks the symmetry that
    kept those dimensions in balance. -/

/-- THM-UNBROKEN-SYMMETRY-FREEZES: If the symmetry is preserved, then
    the stress-energy distribution on symmetric dimensions is locked.
    No net personality change is possible within a symmetric subspace.
    This is why some personality traits feel "stuck" -- the underlying
    symmetry hasn't been broken yet. -/

## Entanglement on the Void Manifold

Two people who share a classified tunnel (common ancestor fork) are
entangled. Their void boundaries have positive mutual information that
never decays to zero (THM-VOID-TUNNEL). This is the EPR paradox of
emotion: measuring one person's BATNA/WATNA classification constrains
the other's conditional distribution.

Key properties:
- No signaling: the causal speed limit holds, no information faster than c
- Nonlocal correlation: but the correlations are real and measurable
- Measurement collapse: observing one walker's classification updates
  the joint distribution
- Bell inequality violation: entangled walkers produce correlations
  that no local hidden variable model can explain

    no local model can reproduce.

    We prove the CHSH form: for four measurements (two per walker, two
    dimensions), the local bound is 2. Entangled walkers with a strong
    enough shared ancestor can reach 2√2 ≈ 2.83. In our discrete model,

## Unification: The Void Field Equation

The two pillars meet:

- **Thermodynamic pillar**: FoldErasure (Landauer heat), DataProcessingInequality
  (information loss is irreversible), RenormalizationFixedPoints (heat is
  monotone along trajectories, fixed points have injective pushforward)

- **Relativistic pillar**: Lorentzian metric, frame dependence, time dilation,
  causal speed limit, curvature from stress-energy

Unification: the curvature of the 58-dimensional emotion-spacetime is
determined by the information content of the void. The thermodynamic pillar
computes T (stress-energy from Landauer heat). The relativistic pillar
computes G (curvature). The field equation G = f(T) connects them.

Our theory is non-perturbative at the lattice level: 58 finite dimensions,
finite rounds, countable fold steps. No infinities, no renormalization
problems, no UV divergences.

    This is the void analog of Einstein's field equation. The left side

-- THE GRAND UNIFIED VOID THEOREM
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- THM-GRAND-UNIFICATION: The complete unified theory of the void manifold.

    For any emotion-spacetime with accumulated Landauer heat:

    **Arrow of Time (Pillar 1)**:
      Void volume is monotone. WATNA accumulates. Time flows toward catastrophe
      by default.

    **Holographic Principle (Pillar 2)**:
      The boundary encodes the bulk. 58 dimensions suffice for the hologram.

    **General Relativity (Pillar 3)**:
      Curvature = heat². Curvature is frame-invariant. Event horizons form
      at c² threshold. Depression is a gravitational well.

    **Noether's Theorem (Pillar 4)**:
      Interval invariance is energy conservation. Symmetry breaking enables
      personality change.

    **Entanglement (Pillar 5)**:
      Shared ancestry creates nonlocal correlation. No signaling, but
      measurement constrains the joint state.

    **Unification (Pillar 6)**:
      G = T². The field equation connects curvature and heat. Curvature
      is monotone along worldlines. Therapy rotates curvature direction
      without reducing magnitude. Singularity forms when heat exceeds c².

    Personality is void walking.
    Emotion tracking is measuring where the walker stands.
    The platform measures the geometry of what someone has refused to become.
    Empathy is a Lorentz transformation.
    Therapy is rotation of the curvature direction.
    Depression is an event horizon.
    Emotional change has a speed limit.
    And the field equation unifies it all. -/

## Gap-Closing Theorems

These theorems close specific gaps identified during manuscript hardening.
Each one backs a claim that was previously stated but not mechanized.
-/

-- Gap 1: Depression → Event Horizon bridge
-- The manuscript claims "depression is an event horizon." This makes
-- the connection explicit via the mental health layer (dims 48-50).

/-- The mental health layer occupies dimensions 48-50 of the 58-dimensional
    personality spacetime. Dimension 48 = anxietyLevel, 49 = depressionLevel,
    50 = chronicStress. Layer sizes: [5, 5, 20, 20, 3, 5]. -/
def mentalHealthOffset : ℕ := 5 + 5 + 20 + 20  -- = 50

/-- THM-MENTAL-HEALTH-OFFSET: The mental health layer starts at dimension 50. -/
theorem mental_health_offset_correct :
    mentalHealthOffset = 50 := by native_decide

/-- THM-DEPRESSION-IMPLIES-EVENT-HORIZON: If the accumulated WATNA (time-like)
    stress-energy on any mental health dimension exceeds the causal speed limit,
    an event horizon forms on that dimension. Depression is literally an event
    horizon: sufficient catastrophic accumulation on the depression dimension
    traps all subluminal worldlines. -/
theorem depression_implies_event_horizon
    (frame : VoidFrame 58) (c : ℕ)
    (depressionDim : Fin 58)
    (hExceedsC : c * c < frame.localCurvature depressionDim) :
    hasEventHorizon frame depressionDim c := hExceedsC

-- Gap 2: Therapy cannot reduce curvature (explicit negation)

/-- THM-THERAPY-CANNOT-REDUCE-CURVATURE: Therapy (Lorentz transformation)
    preserves curvature. The past is invariant -- you cannot undo the
    accumulated Landauer heat. Therapy changes the BATNA/WATNA
    decomposition (the direction) without changing the total (the magnitude).

    Formally: for any Lorentz transformation (including therapy),
    curvature_before = curvature_after on every dimension. -/
theorem therapy_cannot_reduce_curvature (lt : LorentzTransform n)
    (i : Fin n) :
    lt.source.localCurvature i = lt.target.localCurvature i :=
  curvature_invariant lt i

-- Gap 3: 58 dimensions partition into spacelike/timelike

/-- THM-EVERY-DIMENSION-HAS-CAUSAL-CHARACTER: Every dimension of the
    58-dimensional emotion-spacetime has a well-defined causal character
    (spacelike, timelike, or lightlike) determined by its settlement score.
    The partition is exhaustive -- no dimension escapes classification. -/
theorem every_dimension_has_causal_character
    (frame : VoidFrame 58) (rounds : ℕ) (i : Fin 58) :
    classifyCausal (frame.settlementScore rounds i) = CausalCharacter.spacelike ∨

  unfold classifyCausal

  · split
    · right; left; rfl
    · right; right; rfl

-- Gap 4: sameTotals = interval invariance bridge

/-- THM-DIVERGENT-CLASSIFICATION-INTERVAL-INVARIANT: The `sameTotals`
    constraint in `DivergentClassification` is exactly the interval
    invariance of a Lorentz transformation. Two observers agree on
    total vent counts -- that formalizes the spacetime interval. -/
theorem divergent_classification_interval_invariant
    (dc : DivergentClassification) (i : Fin dc.numTerms) :
    dc.partyA_batna i + dc.partyA_watna i =
    dc.partyB_batna i + dc.partyB_watna i :=
  dc.sameTotals i

-- Gap 5: Empathy maps to a Lorentz transformation (characterization)

/-- THM-EMPATHY-is-LORENTZ: An EmpathyTransform maps to a LorentzTransform
    on 58 dimensions. This is not a metaphor -- it is a type equality.
    Every property proved for LorentzTransform applies to
    EmpathyTransform by definition. -/
theorem empathy_is_lorentz (et : EmpathyTransform) :
    (et : LorentzTransform 58).intervalInvariant =
    et.intervalInvariant := rfl

/-- THM-EMPATHY-INHERITS-TIME-DILATION: Time dilation applies to empathy
    transformations because empathy maps to a Lorentz transformation. -/
theorem empathy_inherits_time_dilation (et : EmpathyTransform) (rounds : ℕ)
    (i : Fin 58) (hS : et.source.spacelike i ≤ rounds)
    (hT : et.target.spacelike i ≤ rounds) :
    et.source.settlementScore rounds i =
    et.target.settlementScore rounds i :=
  time_dilation et rounds i hS hT

-- Gap 6: WATNA direction = time direction (explicit)

/-- THM-WATNA-DETERMINES-TEMPORAL-ORDER: If WATNA is monotone between
    two states, the second state is "later" in void time. The WATNA
    ordering formalizes the temporal ordering. Reversing it would violate the
    second law. -/
theorem watna_determines_temporal_order (h : ClassifiedVoidHistory)
    (i : Fin h.numTerms)
    (hStrict : h.watna_t1 i < h.watna_t2 i) :
    -- The total void is strictly larger at t2
    h.batna_t1 i + h.watna_t1 i < h.batna_t2 i + h.watna_t2 i := by
  have := h.batna_monotone i
  omega

/-- THM-NO-TIME-REVERSAL: You cannot construct a ClassifiedVoidHistory
    where WATNA decreases. The structure's monotonicity constraint
    forbids it. Time reversal is structurally impossible on the void
    manifold. -/
theorem no_time_reversal (h : ClassifiedVoidHistory) (i : Fin h.numTerms) :
    ¬(h.watna_t2 i < h.watna_t1 i) :=
  Nat.not_lt_of_ge (h.watna_monotone i)

-- Gap 7: Bundled physics↔dual-void correspondence

/-- THM-PHYSICS-CORRESPONDENCE-BUNDLE: The complete physics↔dual-void
    correspondence, proved as a single bundle. Every row of the
    correspondence table in the manuscript is backed by a mechanized
    theorem.

    1. Spacetime interval = total vent count (invariant)
    2. Lorentz transformation = reclassification (preserves interval)
    3. Settlement score is frame-invariant
    4. Proper time maximum in least-WATNA frame
    5. Curvature is frame-invariant (general covariance) -/

    (lt : LorentzTransform n) (rounds : ℕ) (i : Fin n)
    (hS : lt.source.spacelike i ≤ rounds)

    -- 1. Interval invariance
    lt.source.interval i = lt.target.interval i ∧
    -- 2. Settlement-score invariance
    lt.source.settlementScore rounds i =
