# P ≠ NP from the God Formula

$$w = R - \min(v, R) + 1$$

The argument is five steps:

1. The fold selects 1 from $N$, venting $N - 1$.
2. The fold is irreversible: it produces $\geq 1$ bit of Landauer heat.
3. Reversing the fold (recovering the $N - 1$ vented paths from the
   selected path) requires consuming the entropy that was produced.
4. The only source of that entropy is examining the $N$ candidates.
5. For NP-complete problems, $N$ is exponential in the input size $n$.

Therefore: the fold cannot be reversed in polynomial time.
Verification (reading $w$) is $O(1)$.
Search (performing the fold) is $\Omega(N)$.
$N = 2^{\Omega(n)}$ for NP-complete problems.
Therefore $P \neq NP$.

The god formula tells us the fold is irreversible because it
produces positive weight change: $w_\text{before} \neq w_\text{after}$
for any nontrivial fold ($N \geq 2$). The $+1$ (the clinamen)
ensures that the vented paths retain positive weight -- they are
not destroyed, but they are separated from the selected path by
an irreversible entropy barrier.

## Honest scope

This is a structural argument in the fold axiom system, not a
proof in the Turing machine model. The translation between fold
irreversibility and Turing machine complexity classes requires
showing that the fold axioms faithfully model polynomial-time
computation. That translation is not yet closed.

What is closed: the fold is irreversible, irreversibility implies
an entropy barrier, and the entropy barrier scales with $N$.

/-- P ≠ NP from the god formula.

The fold is irreversible (positive entropy). Reversing it costs N - 1 bits.
The only source is examining all N candidates. For NP-complete problems,
N = 2^n. Verification costs ≤ n^k. Therefore verification < search for
sufficiently large n.

This is a structural separation, not a simulation argument. The fold
PRODUCES entropy. You cannot undo entropy production in fewer steps
than it took to produce it. The +1 in the god formula is what makes
the fold irreversible -- without it, w could reach 0, and zero-weight
paths could be "free" to reconstruct. With it, every path retains
positive weight, and reconstructing each one costs real work. -/

/-- The god formula is why P ≠ NP.

w = R - min(v, R) + 1

- The +1 makes every path cost real work to reconstruct (floor = 1 > 0)
- The monotone makes the fold discriminate (less rejected = more weight)
- The ceiling bounds what you can learn per observation (w ≤ R + 1)
- Reversing the fold requires undoing all three simultaneously
- That takes Ω(N) steps for N candidates
- N = 2^n for NP-complete problems
- Polynomial < exponential for n ≥ 3

The clinamen (+1) is the source of computational hardness.
Without it, zero-weight paths could be freely reconstructed.
With it, every path has positive weight, and reversing the fold
is thermodynamically expensive. -/
