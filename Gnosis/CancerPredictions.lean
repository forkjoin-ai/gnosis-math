# Five Novel Predictions from the Cancer Topology Ledger

Each prediction chains three or more mechanized theorems into a claim
that no single theorem makes alone. Each is falsifiable.

For Sandy.

## Prediction 6: Topological Mutation Burden (TMB-T) Outperforms Raw TMB

Traditional Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) counts mutations without
weighting. Topological TMB weights each mutation by |Δσ|, its
topological severity. The prediction: TMB-T correlates with
patient outcomes more strongly than raw TMB because it captures
the structural disruption dimension that raw counting misses.

Chain: THM-TOPO-MUTATION-DETECTION → THM-TOPOLOGICAL-DEFICIT-SEVERITY
     → buleyean_concentration → failure_data_dominates

## Prediction 7: Checkpoint Loss Order Determines Trajectory

The Buleyean complement distribution is path-dependent: the void
boundary records the ORDER of rejections, not just their count.
Two tumors with the same total deficit but different loss sequences
(p53-first vs Rb-first) should have measurably different void
boundaries and therefore different complement distributions.

Chain: buleyean_monotone_nonrejected → buleyean_concentration
     → cancer_beta1_collapse → checkpoint_reduces_divide_weight

## Prediction 8: Synthetic Lethality Is a Topological Phase Transition

Two genes are synthetically lethal when each individual knockout is
tolerable (beta-1 remains above a viability threshold) but the
combined knockout drops beta-1 below the threshold. The threshold
is the minimum beta-1 needed for the complement distribution to
shift away from "divide" fast enough to prevent runaway growth.

Chain: THM-THERAPEUTIC-RESTORATION → deficit_monotone_in_loss
     → partial_retention_less_aggressive → no_failure_no_learning

## Prediction 9: Immunotherapy Response Ratio

The response to checkpoint immunotherapy should correlate with the
ratio of restored immune beta-1 to tumor internal deficit.
A tumor with deficit 7B and immune beta-1 restoration of 2B has
ratio 2/7 = 0.29. A tumor with deficit 2B and immune restoration
of 2B has ratio 2/2 = 1.0. The prediction: higher ratio → better
response, with a critical threshold below which immunotherapy cannot
overcome the tumor's internal deficit.

Chain: immune_restores_population_learning → THM-TOPOLOGICAL-DEFICIT-SEVERITY
     → buleyean_concentration → checkpoint_reduces_divide_weight

## Prediction 10: Cell Division Convergence Bound

The number of checkpoint cycles needed for the complement distribution
to converge (P(divide) stabilizes) is bounded by C* = totalVentBeta1 - 1.
This is the cell-cycle analogue of the void walker convergence bound
from §15. The convergence round predicts the number of cell divisions
before terminal differentiation or quiescence.

Chain: future_deficit_eventually_zero → buleyean_concentration
     → void_walking_regret_bound → buleyean_coherence
