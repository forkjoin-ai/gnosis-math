# Buleyean Logic

A post-fold logic where truth is ground state and proof is rejection.

Boolean logic describes the world after the fold: {true, false}.
Buleyean logic describes the world during convergence: natural numbers
decreasing toward zero as rejections accumulate.

## Primitives

- A proposition is a natural number (the Bule count)
- 0 = proved (ground state)
- n > 0 = n rejections remain
- The only proof step is rejection (decrement by 1)

## Connectives

- NOT A = maxBules - A
- A AND B = A + B
- A OR B = min(A, B)
- A → B = max(0, B - A)
- FORALL = sum
- EXISTS = min

## Self-hosting

This file proves the laws of Buleyean logic using Lean 4, then
proves that Boolean logic is the K=2 special case, establishing
that Buleyean subsumes Boolean.

The next step (Gnosis) will prove these laws using Buleyean logic
itself.  This Lean proof is the bootstrap.

/-- **THM-BULEYEAN-LOGIC**: The laws hold and Boolean is a special case.

    1. Rejection reaches ground state in n steps
    2. AND is commutative, associative, proved iff both proved
    3. OR is commutative, associative, proved iff at least one proved
    4. NOT is involutive, maps proved ↔ maximally open
    5. IMPLIES is reflexive, trivial when premise is harder
    6. OR ≤ AND (disjunction is cheaper)
    7. Boolean AND/OR/NOT are recovered at K=2 -/
