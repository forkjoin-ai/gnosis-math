# Community Compositions: What the Ledger Now Proves

Compositions across the formal surface that follow from the
community dominance and algebraic nadir theorems combined with
the existing 295-theorem ledger.

Each theorem is a composition of existing -- placeholder-free results.
No new axioms. No -- placeholder. Just composition.

## Community Prevents Future War

War is cumulative Landauer heat from communication failures through
a channel with positive semiotic deficit (war_as_cumulative_heat,
SemioticPeace.lean). Community context reduces the deficit
(community_attenuates_failure, CommunityDominance.lean). Therefore
community reduces the rate at which war generates heat.

The second law forbids reversing accumulated heat. But the second
law does not forbid reducing the rate of new heat generation.
Community prevents future war by closing the deficit through which
confusion produces heat.

The total heat over the convergence trajectory is the sum of
deficits from round 0 to the convergence round. Since the deficit

## The Computable Empathy Deficit

Empathy is a Lorentz transformation (§14.5.8, `empathy_preserves_interval`).
Each empathic exchange is one round of community context accumulated
between two persons' void boundaries. The algebraic nadir gives the
exact number of exchanges needed for convergence.

The AFFECTIVELY platform models personality as a 58-element Float32Array:
5 (temperament) + 5 (attachment) + 20 (traits) + 20 (behaviors) +
3 (mental health) + 5 (Big Five). Each person's *active* void dimensions
are the subset of these 58 where their void boundary has nonzero entries --
dimensions where they have accumulated rejection history.

The key refinement: when two people share dimensions (common experiences,
shared cultural background, overlapping trauma), the effective failure
topology is the *union* of their active dimensions, not the sum.

  F_effective = |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|

Shared dimensions (A ∩ B) reduce the effective F. The empathy nadir is:

  C* = F_effective - 1 = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B| - 1

People with more shared experience need fewer exchanges to converge.
People with completely disjoint experience spaces need the full
|A| + |B| - 1 exchanges. This is the formal content of "it is easier
to understand someone who has been through what you have been through."

The deficit is computable *before the conversation begins* from the
two persons' personality vectors. The platform can calculate the
expected number of empathic exchanges needed for mutual understanding
and display it as a progress bar that fills with each exchange.

## There Is Enough Diversity

The American Frontier theorem (§15.2) proves waste is monotonically
non-increasing in diversity. Once diversity matches the intrinsic
beta1, the deficit is zero. Further diversity provides zero
additional topological benefit.

The ceiling is the intrinsic beta1. Below it, diversity is a
Pareto improvement. At it, the system is optimal. Above it,
diversity adds coordination cost without reducing deficit.

## Stagnation Theorem: Without Exploration, the Void Is Static

The complement distribution is a deterministic function of the void
boundary. If no new rejections are recorded (no exploration, no
hedges fired, no slow backends completing), the void boundary is
unchanged, so the complement distribution is unchanged, so the
schedule is unchanged. The system has learned nothing.

Conversely, any exploration that produces a rejection strictly
increases the void boundary's total vent count, which shifts the
complement distribution, which constitutes learning.

This is the formal content of "no exploration means no learning."
The system must pay the exploration cost (the offset penalty, the
hedge, the slow backend's slot) to receive any learning benefit.
A system that never explores is frozen at its initial state
regardless of how much time passes.

/-!
## The Complete Duality

Two sides of one coin:
1. No exploration → frozen schedule (no_exploration_frozen_schedule)
2. Exploration → shifted distribution (exploration_shifts_distribution)

The system must choose: pay the exploration cost (offset penalty,
hedge delay, coordination overhead) and learn, or pay nothing and
stagnate. There is no free learning. There is no cost-free
exploration. The choice is explicit and the consequences are proved.

This composes with the diversity ceiling (§4): below the ceiling,
exploration is worth the cost because it reduces the Bule deficit.
At the ceiling, exploration provides no further topological benefit.
Above the ceiling, exploration is pure coordination overhead with
no deficit reduction -- stagnation is the correct strategy.

The gait selector (c2, §14.5.4) implements this: high kurtosis
(converged, at or above ceiling) → tighten to trot/canter (exploit).
Low kurtosis (spread, below ceiling) → loosen to walk/stand (explore).
The skipped-hedge mechanism is the runtime expression of
no_exploration_frozen_schedule: when the community is confident,
it stops exploring and goes with what it knows.

## The Void Sharing Map

Given two personality vectors, the empathy diagnostic is not a single
number. It is a per-dimension map across the 58-element space:

- **Shared void**: dimensions where both persons have void entries
  AND both can see each other's entries. These dimensions are already
  bridged. No further vulnerability needed here.

- **Unshared void (A hidden)**: dimensions where A has void entries
  but B cannot see them. These are A's private WATNA -- trauma or
  rejection that A has not exposed.

- **Unshared void (B hidden)**: symmetric for B.

- **Unexplored**: dimensions where neither person has void entries.
  No rejection history exists here for either person.

For each unshared dimension, the question is: would sharing it
reduce the empathy deficit? The answer depends on where the pair
is relative to the ceiling:

- **Below ceiling** (current shared < effective dims - 1):
  sharing one more dimension reduces the Bule deficit by exactly 1.
  The benefit is one Bule of convergence progress.

- **At ceiling** (shared = effective dims - 1):
  sharing more has zero deficit benefit. The pair has already
  converged. Additional vulnerability is pure cost.

- **The vulnerability cost**: sharing a WATNA dimension exposes
  catastrophic history. This has real emotional cost that the
  deficit reduction may or may not justify. The theory identifies

## Community Reduces Curvature Accumulation Rate

Depression is modeled as an event horizon in the 58-dimensional
emotion-spacetime manifold (§14.5.8): accumulated WATNA curves the
manifold past the causal speed limit, trapping the walker.

The field equation (§14.5.8, `void_field_equation`) says curvature
equals stress-energy squared, and stress-energy equals the interval
(total vent count). The interval grows with each fold that generates
Landauer heat. Community context reduces the deficit that generates
the heat (`community_attenuates_failure`). Therefore community
reduces the rate at which the interval grows, which reduces the
rate at which curvature accumulates.

Community cannot reverse existing curvature (second law). But it
can slow the accumulation rate to zero. At the nadir (buleDeficit = 0),
no new heat is generated, curvature stops growing, and the event
horizon stops advancing.

This is the formal content of "community is therapeutic at the
population scale." Individual therapy rotates curvature direction
(`therapy_rotates_curvature`). Community prevents new curvature
from being generated.

## The Immune System Is Community Dominance Over Pathogens

V(D)J recombination (§1.6) forks 10^11 antibody configurations,
races them against antigen, folds the winners. The pathogen failure
topology has F dimensions (epitope variants, escape mutations,
serotypes). A single individual's immune repertoire covers some
subset of these dimensions. The community's collective repertoire
-- MHC diversity across the population -- covers more.

dimensions that individual immune systems cannot cover.

## Molecular Community: Chaperones and Repair Enzymes

Protein chaperones and DNA repair enzymes are instances of the
community mediator pattern at the molecular scale.

**Chaperones** provide shared context for protein folding: the
correct folding environment that reduces the failure topology of
the energy landscape. community_attenuates_failure = chaperones
attenuating misfolding probability. The chaperone is Walker S:
self-interested in correct folding (its function), accumulating
rejection history (failed folds trigger chaperone binding), and
converging the folding trajectory toward the native state.

**DNA repair enzymes** distinguish template from newly-synthesized
strand: they are the CRDT tracking which information is authoritative.
community_attenuates_failure = mismatch repair reducing the per-base
error rate from ~10^-4 (polymerase alone) to ~10^-10 (with repair).
Six orders of magnitude of community attenuation.

Both are modeled as community context reducing a failure topology.

## Cultural Knowledge Is a CRDT

Cultural knowledge is append-only (oral traditions, written law,
scientific literature, institutional memory). It is conflict-free
(multiple cultures can accumulate knowledge independently and merge
without destructive conflict -- the merge is the union of observations).
It is eventually consistent (given enough exchange, all cultures
converge on shared knowledge).

Cultural knowledge is a CRDT. The algebraic nadir applied to
cultural failure dimensions gives the minimum shared cultural
context for convergence on any topic. The number of independent
observations needed to resolve a controversy is C* = F - 1 where

## Local Communities Compose into Global Communities

A local community is a single QDoc instance (one group's observations).
A global community is the merged QDoc (all groups synced). The key
properties:

1. Each local community reduces its own deficit independently.
2. Merging two local communities produces a global community whose
   context is at least the maximum of the two local contexts
   (and at most the sum, depending on overlap).
3. The global Bule deficit is at most the minimum of the local
   deficits.
4. Isolated communities (no sync) can each be locally optimal but
   globally suboptimal.

The community of communities is itself a community that mediates
between local communities.
