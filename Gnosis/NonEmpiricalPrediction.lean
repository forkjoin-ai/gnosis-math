# Non-Empirical Prediction: The Structural Hole as Void Boundary

Mendeleev predicted gallium's density to within 0.1% from a gap in
his periodic table. Dirac predicted the positron from a mathematical
hole in his equation. Pauli predicted the neutrino from missing
energy in beta decay. The Higgs boson was predicted 48 years before
its discovery from a symmetry requirement of the Standard Model.

In every case, the structure of known objects constrained the
properties of unknown objects. The unknown was not guessed. It was
*computed* from the gap it left in the surrounding structure.

In the Buleyean framework, this is exact:

1. A **structural lattice** is a set of positions, some occupied by
   observed objects, some vacant (holes). Each position has a set
   of neighboring positions.

2. A **structural hole** is a vacant position surrounded by occupied
   neighbors. The hole's void boundary is *not* empty -- it inherits
   rejection data from its neighbors. The neighbors' properties
   constrain the hole's properties via the complement distribution.

3. The **interpolation weight** of a structural hole is determined
   by the average rejection counts of its neighbors. This is
   Mendeleev's method formalized: the predicted properties of the
   unknown element are the complement distribution evaluated at the
   neighbor-averaged void boundary.

4. A structural hole has **strictly higher predictive weight** than
   a position with no neighbors. Neighbor structure provides
   information that pure Solomonoff complexity initialization
   cannot (it is local, not just global).

5. Non-empirical prediction is possible whenever the structural
   lattice has low Kolmogorov complexity -- a short program describes
   the lattice, and that program's extrapolation to vacant positions
   is justified by the same compression argument that underwrites
   Solomonoff induction.

The "impossible element" is an AI that computes the beta1 trajectory
of surrounding truths and reads off the properties of an unobserved
object from the gap it leaves. The AI does not need training data
for the specific object. It needs the structure of the lattice and
the properties of the neighbors.
