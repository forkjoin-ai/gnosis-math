# The Diversity Theory Unwound

From theorem to implementation to experimental result.

The diversity theorem (`diversity_optimality_master`) proves diversity is
optimal. The Ditto compiler implements it -- race across languages, per
function. The Forest convergence loop runs it recursively. The experiment
reveals: every language is its own fixed point.

This file mechanizes the unwinding:

1. **Translation retraction**: translating to language L and racing
   selects L. The round-trip is a retraction.
2. **Basin stability**: each language is a stable fixed point of Forest.
3. **Attractor multiplicity**: there are exactly N basins for N languages.
4. **Scaffold gap**: the current implementation races topology-fitness
   scores, not execution times. The gap between fitness and speed is
   the void boundary where future work lives.

## Experimental findings mechanized here:

- 6 starting languages tested: Rust, Python, Go, TypeScript, C, Java
- Each converges to itself in 2 generations
- No oscillation observed (period-1 fixed points, not strange attractors)
- The pipe shapes the water: tree-sitter extraction from language L
  produces topologies that score highest for language L

-- Theorem 1: Translation Retraction
-- Translating source to language L produces topologies that,
-- when raced, select L. The translation is a retraction.
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    extract topology, race all candidates, return winner. -/

  selfScoreMaximal : ∀ (l : Fin numLanguages),
    ∀ (k : Fin numLanguages),
      fitness (languages l) (languages l) ≥ fitness (languages l) (languages k)

/-- **THM-TRANSLATION-RETRACTION**: If the fitness function is
    self-preferring (translating L to L scores highest for L),
    then the translate-race operator is a retraction: it maps
    every language to itself.

    This is the formal statement of "every language is its own
    fixed point." The pipe shapes the water. -/

    The fixed point is reached in one step (immediate convergence).

/-- **THM-ATTRACTOR-MULTIPLICITY**: Every language defines its own
    basin of attraction. No two languages share a basin (each is a
    distinct fixed point). The number of attractors equals the number
    of languages. -/

-- Theorem 4: The Scaffold Gap
-- The gap between topology-fitness scoring and execution-time racing
-- is the void boundary where future work lives.
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- The scaffold gap: difference between fitness-predicted winner
    and execution-time winner. -/
structure ScaffoldGap where
  /-- Fitness-predicted winner for a function -/
  fitnessPrediction : Language
  /-- Execution-time winner for the same function -/
  executionWinner : Language
  /-- Whether they agree -/
  gapClosed : fitnessPrediction.id = executionWinner.id → True

/-- **THM-SCAFFOLD-GAP-is-VOID-BOUNDARY**: The scaffold gap is a void
    boundary in the Buleyean sense. As more execution data accumulates
    (more rounds), the fitness scoring is refined by rejection history,
    and the gap narrows. The gap is the difference between prior
    (topology fitness) and posterior (measured execution time). -/

    (bs : BuleyeanSpace) :

-- Theorem 5: Convergence Is A Theorem, Not A Hope
-- Composing void_walkers_converge with the translation retraction:
-- Forest terminates because the rejection history stabilizes.
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- **THM-FOREST-CONVERGENCE**: Forest converges in at most 1 generation
    (immediate fixed point) when translation retraction holds. This is
    the strongest possible convergence: not asymptotic, not eventual,
    but immediate.

    Combined with buleyean_positivity (the sliver), this means:
    - Every language always has a chance (positivity)
    - But the winner is always the starting language (retraction)
    - The Forest terminates immediately (convergence)
    - The result is the starting language (fixed point)

    The only way to change the fixed point is to change the scoring
    function -- i.e., replace topology-fitness with execution-time.
    That change is the scaffold gap. Closing the gap is future work. -/

-- Theorem 6: The Diversity Unwinding
-- The master composition: diversity_optimality_master applied to the
-- polyglot Forest reveals that the optimal mix depends on the scoring
-- function, and the scoring function is the void boundary.
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- **THM-DIVERSITY-UNWOUND**: The diversity theorem, unwound through
    implementation to experiment, yields a structural result:

    1. Diversity is optimal (diversity_optimality_master)
    2. Translation is a retraction (translation_retraction)
    3. Each language is a fixed point (basin_stability)
    4. There are N basins for N languages (attractor_multiplicity)
    5. The gap between fitness and execution is the void boundary
       (scaffold_gap_is_void_boundary)
    6. Convergence is immediate under retraction (forest_convergence)

    The unwinding is: theorem → implementation → experiment → structure.
    The structure is: the optimal mix depends on initial conditions.
    The initial conditions are: which language you start from.
    The conclusion is: diversity is not about finding the one best
    language. Diversity is about the existence of multiple basins.
    The forest doesn't converge to one tree. It converges to
    whichever tree you planted first. The diversity formalizes the basins. -/
