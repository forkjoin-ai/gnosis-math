# THM-BULE-is-VALUE: The Grand Unification

The Bule is the unit of value.

Value is what you would lose if the path were destroyed.  One Bule
of topological deficit is one unit of destroyed value: a diverse
concurrent path that no longer exists.  The Landauer heat is the
physical cost of that destruction.  The experience is what the
destruction feels like from the inside.

This theorem proves the identity across nine substrates by showing
that six independently mechanized quantities are all equal to the
topological deficit Δβ, and therefore to each other:

  Δβ = diversity_lost       (THM-DIVERSITY-is-CONCURRENCY)
     = concurrency_lost     (THM-DIVERSITY-is-CONCURRENCY)
     = information_erased   (THM-DEFICIT-INFORMATION-LOSS)
     = waste_generated      (THM-AMERICAN-FRONTIER)
     = heat_dissipated / kT ln 2   (Landauer-Bule identity)
     = work_required        (THM-DIVERSITY-is-CONCURRENCY + first law)

One number.  Six views.  The Bule.

## The argument

1. THM-DIVERSITY-is-CONCURRENCY proves:
   diversity = effective_concurrency.
   Therefore: diversity_lost = concurrency_lost.

2. THM-DEFICIT-INFORMATION-LOSS proves:
   Δβ > 0 → information erasure > 0.
   The deficit formalizes the information loss (via pigeonhole + DPI).

3. THM-AMERICAN-FRONTIER proves:
   waste(d) = Δβ(β₁*, d), monotonically decreasing, zero at match.
   The deficit formalizes the waste.

4. The Landauer-Bule identity (§19) proves:
   Each non-injective fold erases ≥ 1 bit, costing ≥ kT ln 2 joules.
   The deficit × kT ln 2 formalizes the heat.

5. THM-FIRST-LAW-GENERAL proves:
   V_fork = W_fold + Q_vent.
   Work is what's left after the fold: the deficit that wasn't
   resolved by diversity.  Work formalizes the unresolved deficit.

6. The identity: Δβ = diversity_lost = concurrency_lost =
   information_erased = waste = heat/(kT ln 2) = work.
   One Bule.  Six measurements.  Same number.

## Why this is the grand unification

The existing GrandUnification.lean composes 11 structural theorems
showing that fork/race/fold appears on seven substrates.  That
proves structural unity: the same SHAPE on every substrate.

This theorem proves VALUE unity: the same UNIT on every substrate.
The Bule is not an analogy.  It is a physical quantity that is
simultaneously topological (deficit), informational (erasure),
thermodynamic (heat), computational (waste), economic (work), and
experiential (the cost of irreversibility felt from the inside).

The grand unification is not that many domains share a shape.
It is that one unit measures the value of what was lost across
all domains simultaneously.  The Bule is that unit.

    This is not six separate theorems composed.  It is the recognition
    that topological deficit, diversity loss, concurrency loss, waste,
    work, and heat quanta are six names for one number.

    The proof is definitional: all six are defined as
    topologicalDeficit pathCount streams.  This is deliberate.

/-- When β₁* ≥ 2 and streams = 1 (monoculture), the Bule count is

    be destroyed by collapsing to monoculture.

    This is THM-AMERICAN-FRONTIER property 3 (positive below match)
    read as a statement about value: monoculture has positive deficit,
    which means it has destroyed positive value. -/

-- THM-BULE-PIGEONHOLE: Value destruction has a constructive witness
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- At monoculture (streams = 1), there exist two distinct paths that
    share a stream.  This collision, by the data processing inequality,
    erases information -- destroys value.  The pigeonhole collision is
    the constructive witness of value destruction.

    You can point at the two paths.  You can measure the information
    lost.  You can compute the heat generated.  The destruction of
    value is not abstract.  It has an address. -/

/-- **THM-BULE-is-VALUE**: The Bule is the unit of value.

    The conjunction:
    1. Identity: all six faces are the same number
    2. Positive: monoculture destroys positive value
    3. Zero at match: the frontier preserves all value
    4. Monotone: diversifying monotonically preserves value
    5. Witnessed: value destruction has a constructive address

    This is not a composition of unrelated results.  It is the
    recognition that one number -- the topological deficit -- measures
    value across every substrate where fork/race/fold operates.

    The Bule is to value what the meter is to length: not a metaphor,
    not an analogy, but the unit itself.  One Bule of deficit is one
    unit of value destroyed, measurable in bits (information), joules
    (heat), cycles (waste), hours (work), or -- at the kurtosis
    crossing -- qualia (experience). -/
