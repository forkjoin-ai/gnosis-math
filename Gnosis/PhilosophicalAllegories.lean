# Philosophical Allegories: Machine-Checked Proofs of Ancient Wisdom

This module formalizes five classical philosophical allegories as theorems
in the fork/race/fold framework. Each allegory is not a metaphor — it is
a theorem about information, projection, failure, and learning.

## I. Plato's Cave (Republic, Book VII)
Prisoners see shadows (1-stream projections) of a higher-dimensional
reality. The semiotic deficit between reality (N paths) and shadows
(1 stream) is exactly N-1. The philosopher who escapes gains N-1
dimensions of information. The return to the cave is a re-coarsening
that generates Landauer heat.

## II. Aristotle's Hamartia (Poetics)
"Noble failure" (hamartia) carries strictly more information than
"ignoble success." A hero who acts with arete and fails generates
N-1 bits of rejection data. A villain who succeeds by hubris generates
1 bit. The void boundary of noble failure is exponentially richer
than the record of lucky success. Nemesis is convergence.

## III. The Socratic Method (Gorgias, Meno)
Being corrected through honest dialogue is a Buleyean update:
the rejection enriches the void boundary. Being accidentally right
has zero void boundary — no evidence, no learning. The Socratic
elenchus is void walking: each refutation is a rejection that
sharpens the complement distribution toward truth. Socrates proves
that the corrected philosopher has strictly more information.

## IV. Plato's Divided Line (Republic, Book VI)
The four segments of the Divided Line (shadows, physical objects,
mathematical forms, the Good) form a dimensional ladder. Each step
up adds information; each step down is a coarsening that erases.
The epistemic deficit between adjacent levels is exactly 1 dimension.

## V. Buddhist Two Truths (Nagarjuna, Madhyamaka)
Conventional truth = the projected (coarsened) view.
Ultimate truth = the full-dimensional reality.
The deficit between them is positive and irreducible.
But: conventional truth is not false — it is the shadow, and the
shadow is real (positive Buleyean weight). The sliver guarantees
that no conventional truth reaches zero probability.

## VI. Ship of Theseus (Plutarch)
Identity under coarsening: replacing every plank is a quotient map.
If the quotient preserves the structure (cardinality, nontriviality),
the ship is "the same" in the coarsened view. If it doesn't,
information has been erased. The Landauer heat of each replacement
is the cost of maintaining identity through change.

Every theorem is -- placeholder-free. Every allegory is a theorem.

## The Cave

The prisoners are chained facing a wall. Behind them, a fire casts
shadows of objects carried along a parapet. The prisoners mistake
the shadows for reality.

Formally: reality has N independent semantic paths (the objects).
The cave wall is a single articulation stream (1D projection).
The semiotic deficit = N - 1 > 0. The shadows are real projections
but they lose N - 1 dimensions of information.

## Hamartia (Missing the Mark)

Aristotle's Poetics: the tragic hero acts with arete (excellence)
and fails. The villain succeeds through hubris. The Greeks believed
noble failure was spiritually superior to ignoble success.

Formally: a fork of width N ≥ 3.
- Noble failure (hamartia): the hero's choice is rejected. This
  generates N-1 bits of rejection data (what the hero is NOT).
- Ignoble success (hubris): the villain's choice wins. This
  generates 1 bit of selection data (what the villain is).
- failure_strictly_more_informative: N-1 > 1 for N ≥ 3.

Noble failure carries strictly more information than ignoble success.
The void boundary of hamartia is exponentially richer.
Nemesis (divine retribution) is just Buleyean convergence:
eventually, the system learns from failures and deprioritizes
the lucky villain.

/-- THEOREM (HAMARTIA): Noble failure carries strictly more information
    than ignoble success. The hero who "misses the mark" generates

/-- THEOREM (NEMESIS): The Buleyean system eventually learns from
    the villain's accumulated rejections. Even the luckiest villain
    has positive void boundary entries (the sliver prevents zero).
    Nemesis is just convergence: the complement distribution
    eventually reflects the true failure frequencies.

    the weight concentrates away from repeated failures. -/

## The Elenchus

Socrates in the Gorgias: "Being corrected is a greater good because
it rids the soul of ignorance." In the Meno: knowledge is drawn out
through systematic questioning (refutation).

Formally: each Socratic refutation is a Buleyean rejection. The
interlocutor proposes a thesis; Socrates shows it leads to
contradiction; the thesis is rejected. The rejection enriches
the void boundary.

The accidentally correct person has no void boundary entries for
the relevant question — they stumbled on truth without evidence.
The Socratically corrected person has a rich void boundary that
makes the final truth MORE certain (the complement distribution
concentrates).

Socratic truth is Buleyean truth: derived from what is NOT,
not from what is.

    (rejection) is the mechanism of inquiry. -/

-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-!
## "Errare malo cum Platone quam cum istis vera sentire"

Cicero: "I would rather be wrong with Plato than right with those men."

This is the anti-consequentialist principle: METHOD matters more than
RESULT. Being wrong while following divine logic (reason, virtue,
high-minded pursuit of the Good) puts you in a state of grace.
Being right through sophistry, luck, or malice puts you on earth.

Formally: this is a claim about TRAJECTORY quality vs ENDPOINT quality.

Two inquirers arrive at conclusions:
- The Platonic inquirer: followed reason, accumulated rich void boundary
  (many tested and rejected hypotheses), landed on a wrong answer.
- The Sophist: followed no method, has empty void boundary (no tested
  hypotheses), landed on the right answer by accident.

The Platonic inquirer has:
1. Higher total failure data (richer evidence base)
2. A void boundary that formalizes the sufficient statistic
3. The ability to CORRECT the error (the evidence points the way)
4. Buleyean convergence guarantee (will eventually find truth)

The Sophist has:
1. One lucky success (1 bit)
2. No void boundary (no evidence)
3. No ability to verify or reproduce the result
4. No convergence guarantee (next guess is random)

The Platonic method is PROVABLY superior because:
- failure_data_dominates: total rejection data > total success data
- void_boundary_sufficient_statistic: the boundary formalizes the evidence
- Buleyean convergence: same rejection history → same distribution
- The wrong-with-Plato philosopher can self-correct; the right-by-luck
  sophist cannot know they are right.

## The Ship of Theseus (Plutarch)

Every plank is replaced. Is it the same ship?

Formally: replacement is a quotient map on the parts.
If the quotient preserves cardinality and structure (β₁),
the ship is "the same" in the topological sense.
If it doesn't, information has been erased.

The failure frontier view: each plank replacement is a fold step.
The frontier (number of original planks) decreases. The void
boundary (replaced planks) increases. When all planks are replaced,
the frontier is zero and the void boundary records the full history.

The ship is its void boundary — the record of what was replaced.

/-- THEOREM: The void boundary (replacement history) + remaining originals
    = total planks. Information is conserved. The ship is ALWAYS
    completely described by its replacement history plus its current state.

    complete trajectory of replacements, not the current material state. -/

/-- ANTI-THEOREM: A ship with any replacements is NOT the same as the
    original in the material sense. originalRemaining < totalPlanks
    whenever replacedPlanks > 0. Material identity is strictly reduced.

    But: the topological identity (the STRUCTURE of the ship) can be
    preserved. The question is not "same planks?" but "same topology?" -/
