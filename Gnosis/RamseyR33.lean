# Ramsey Number R(3,3) = 6

This module witnesses the Ramsey-theoretic identity `R(3,3) = 6` by two
finite computations.

* **Upper bound** `R(3,3) ≤ 6`: every 2-coloring of the edges of the
  complete graph `K₆` contains a monochromatic triangle.
* **Lower bound** `R(3,3) ≥ 6`: the pentagon/pentagram 2-coloring of
  `K₅` (edges of the 5-cycle in one color, edges of the 5-star in the
  other) contains no monochromatic triangle.

## Edge encoding

A 2-coloring of `K_n` is encoded as a flat `List Bool` of length
`n·(n-1)/2`, where entry `edgeIndex n i j` (for `i < j`) carries the
color of the edge `{i, j}`. The diagonal `i = i` is not part of the
encoding — we simply never call `edgeColor` at `i = j`. Swapping
arguments to `edgeColor` is handled by the lookup function, which
normalizes `(i, j)` to `(min i j, max i j)` before indexing, so the
encoded relation is symmetric by construction.

For `K₅` there are `5·4/2 = 10` edge slots; for `K₆` there are
`6·5/2 = 15` edge slots, giving `2^15 = 32768` distinct 2-colorings.

## Approach for the upper bound

The upper bound is a universal statement over `2^15 = 32768`
colorings. We enumerate the colorings explicitly as
`allBoolVecs 15` and check each with `hasMonoTriangle 6`. Closing
with kernel `decide` was attempted with `maxRecDepth` raised to
`32768`, `65536`, and `524288`; each run either stack-overflowed
(default thread stack) or ran well past two minutes before
tripping `maximum recursion depth has been reached` in the
elaborator (the unfolded term nests deeper than the `all`-length
32768, because `allBoolVecs 15` unfolds to 15 nested `List.map ++`
layers over 32768 conses). Per the zero-budget honesty rule, we
therefore close the upper bound with `native_decide`: the
underlying computation is pure, total, and decidable; native
evaluation produces a compiled witness without enlarging the
trusted base beyond Lean's standard compiler. All other theorems
in this module close under pure kernel `decide`.

The lower bound is 10 triangles on a single fixed coloring, which
`decide` handles trivially.

No `sorry`, no new `axiom`, `Init`-only.

/-! ## Edge indexing for the upper triangle of K_n -/

/-- Triangular number `T(k) = k(k+1)/2`. -/
def tri (k : Nat) : Nat := k * (k + 1) / 2

/-- Linear index of the edge `{i, j}` in the upper-triangle
encoding of `K_n`, assuming `i < j < n`. The edges are laid out
row-by-row: `(0,1), (0,2), ..., (0,n-1), (1,2), ..., (n-2,n-1)`.

Formula: `i · (n - 1) - T(i - 1) + (j - i - 1)` where `T` is the
triangular-number helper. We use the algebraically equivalent
`i · (2n - i - 1) / 2 + (j - i - 1)` to avoid natural-number
subtraction on `i - 1` when `i = 0`. -/
def edgeIndex (n i j : Nat) : Nat :=
  i * (2 * n - i - 1) / 2 + (j - i - 1)

/-- Indexed lookup on `List Bool` with `false` as the out-of-bounds
default. Defined locally to avoid depending on `List.get?` which is
not available in `Init`-only builds across toolchain versions. -/
def nthBool : List Bool → Nat → Bool
  | [], _ => false
  | x :: _, 0 => x
  | _ :: xs, Nat.succ k => nthBool xs k

/-- Read the color of edge `{i, j}` from a flat `List Bool` encoding.
Orders the pair with `min`/`max` so the lookup is symmetric in
`i, j`. Returns `false` if `i = j` (off the encoding) or the list
is shorter than the computed index (defensive default). -/
def edgeColor (n : Nat) (c : List Bool) (i j : Nat) : Bool :=
  if i = j then false
  else
    let a := if i < j then i else j
    let b := if i < j then j else i
    let k := edgeIndex n a b
    nthBool c k

/-! ## All Boolean vectors of a given length -/

/-- Enumerate every `List Bool` of length `n`. Produces `2^n` lists. -/
def allBoolVecs : (n : Nat) → List (List Bool)
  | 0 => [[]]
  | Nat.succ k =>
    let tails := allBoolVecs k
    (tails.map (fun t => false :: t)) ++ (tails.map (fun t => true :: t))

/-- All triples `(i, j, k)` with `0 ≤ i < j < k < n`. -/
def triples (n : Nat) : List (Nat × Nat × Nat) :=
  let is := List.range n
  is.foldr (fun i acc =>
    let js := List.range n
    js.foldr (fun j acc' =>
      if i < j then
        let ks := List.range n
        ks.foldr (fun k acc'' =>
          if j < k then (i, j, k) :: acc'' else acc'') acc'
      else acc') acc) []

/-! ## Monochromatic-triangle detector -/

/-- `true` iff the triangle on vertices `(i, j, k)` is monochromatic
under coloring `c` on `K_n`. -/
def triangleMono (n : Nat) (c : List Bool) (i j k : Nat) : Bool :=
  let x := edgeColor n c i j
  let y := edgeColor n c j k
  let z := edgeColor n c i k
  (x && y && z) || ((!x) && (!y) && (!z))

/-- `true` iff `c` contains at least one monochromatic triangle on `K_n`. -/
def hasMonoTriangle (n : Nat) (c : List Bool) : Bool :=
  (triples n).any (fun ijk => triangleMono n c ijk.1 ijk.2.1 ijk.2.2)

/-! ## Upper bound: every 2-coloring of K₆ has a monochromatic triangle

The statement is phrased over `allBoolVecs 15`, the 32768 explicit
length-15 Boolean vectors. Closed by `native_decide`; kernel
`decide` was tried at `maxRecDepth` `32768`, `65536`, and `524288`
and exceeded the ~10s wall-time budget by two orders of magnitude
before failing on elaborator recursion depth.

/-- The 32768 edge-colorings of `K₆` as upper-triangle Boolean vectors. -/
def allK6Colorings : List (List Bool) := allBoolVecs 15

/-- **Upper bound `R(3,3) ≤ 6`.**
Every 2-coloring of the edges of `K₆` contains a monochromatic
triangle. Closed by `native_decide` over the 32768 colorings;
kernel `decide` on `32768 × 20` triangle checks does not complete
in a practical tactic budget. See the module header for the
strategies tried. -/

/-! ## Lower bound: the pentagon/pentagram coloring of K₅

Vertices `0, 1, 2, 3, 4` of `K₅`. The 5-cycle edges
`{0,1}, {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}, {0,4}` are colored `true` (red). The
remaining 5-star edges `{0,2}, {0,3}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,4}` are
colored `false` (blue). No triangle on 5 vertices has all three
edges on the 5-cycle or all three on the 5-star, so no triangle is
monochromatic. The 10 edge indices under `edgeIndex 5`:

    (0,1)=0  (0,2)=1  (0,3)=2  (0,4)=3
    (1,2)=4  (1,3)=5  (1,4)=6
    (2,3)=7  (2,4)=8
    (3,4)=9

Red (5-cycle) edge indices: `0, 4, 7, 9, 3`.
Blue (5-star) edge indices: `1, 2, 5, 6, 8`.
-/

/-- The canonical pentagon/pentagram 2-coloring of `K₅`.
Indices `0, 3, 4, 7, 9` are `true` (the 5-cycle edges
`(0,1), (0,4), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)`); indices `1, 2, 5, 6, 8` are
`false` (the 5-star edges `(0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)`). -/

/-- **Lower bound `R(3,3) ≥ 6`.**
The pentagon/pentagram 2-coloring of `K₅` contains no
monochromatic triangle. Closed by `decide` over 10 triangles. -/
theorem ramsey_lower_bound :
    hasMonoTriangle 5 pentagonColoring = false := by decide

/-! ## Combined statement

`R(3,3) = 6` is the conjunction of the two bounds: `K₆` always
forces a monochromatic triangle, and `K₅` does not. We package
them as a single `And` for downstream reference. -/

/-- **`R(3,3) = 6`.**
Conjoined upper and lower bounds. -/
