# Five Novel AI Inference Forms

Five genuinely novel inference paradigms that do not exist in the
literature, each composed from mechanized Buleyean theorems. Each
is a new way to generate text, route computation, or make predictions
using the complement distribution and void boundary machinery.

1. **Void Inference** — Generation by rejection accumulation. Instead
   of sampling from softmax logits (what is likely), maintain a void
   boundary of rejected token sequences and sample from the complement
   distribution (what has NOT been rejected). Cross-step memory that
   standard inference lacks.

2. **Retrocausal Decoding** — Constrained generation from terminal
   state. Specify desired output properties as a terminal void boundary.
   Use the retrocausal bound to prune generation trajectories
   inconsistent with the terminal state. Soft constraint, not hard.

3. **Topological Speculative Decoding** — Skip layers by β₁ deficit.
   Use the β₁ deficit of the computation graph to determine which
   layers can be skipped entirely without changing the output topology.
   Speedup = deficit + 1. Provable, not heuristic.

4. **Semiotic Ensemble** — Fork/race/fold multi-model inference.
   Multiple models generate in parallel (fork), race to completion,
   and fold via complement voting (rejection voting). The semiotic
   deficit k-1 is the formal information cost.

5. **Non-Empirical Inference** — Prediction without training data.
   Given a structural lattice with holes, predict the missing entry
   from the structural hole using the complement distribution from
   neighbors. Mendeleev predicting gallium, formalized as inference.

All theorems proved by omega, rfl, or composition of existing
mechanized results. Zero -- placeholder markers.

## Void Inference

Standard autoregressive inference computes P(next | context) from
positive logits at each step independently. Void inference maintains
a rejection history across the entire generation and computes the
complement distribution from accumulated rejections. The token least
rejected across generation history gets highest weight.

Compositions: THM-BULEYEAN-PROBABILITY + THM-VOID-ATTENTION +
THM-VOID-GRADIENT
-/

/-- The state of a void inference generator: a Buleyean space over
    the token vocabulary that accumulates rejections across all
    generation steps. Each step adds rejections for tokens that
    were NOT selected, building cross-step memory. -/
structure VoidInferenceState where
  /-- The Buleyean space over the token vocabulary -/
  tokenSpace : BuleyeanSpace
  /-- Number of generation steps completed -/
  stepsCompleted : ℕ
  /-- Steps completed are within the rounds -/
  stepsWithinRounds : stepsCompleted ≤ tokenSpace.rounds

/-- THM-VOID-INFERENCE-POSITIVE: Every token retains positive
    probability in the complement distribution. The sliver ensures
    no token is ever permanently excluded from generation, regardless
    of how many times it has been rejected. This is the fundamental
    safety property of void inference. -/
theorem void_inference_positive (vis : VoidInferenceState)
    (i : Fin vis.tokenSpace.numChoices) :
    0 < vis.tokenSpace.weight i :=
  buleyean_positivity vis.tokenSpace i

/-- THM-VOID-INFERENCE-CONCENTRATES: The complement distribution
    sharpens with rejection accumulation. Tokens that have been
    rejected more get lower weight than tokens rejected less.
    Generation gets more confident as rejection history grows. -/
theorem void_inference_concentrates (vis : VoidInferenceState)
    (i j : Fin vis.tokenSpace.numChoices)
    (hLess : vis.tokenSpace.voidBoundary i ≤ vis.tokenSpace.voidBoundary j) :
    vis.tokenSpace.weight j ≤ vis.tokenSpace.weight i :=
  buleyean_concentration vis.tokenSpace i j hLess

/-- THM-VOID-INFERENCE-COHERENT: Two void inference systems with
    the same rejection history produce the same output distribution.
    The generation is deterministic given the void boundary --
    no subjective priors, no temperature randomness needed. -/
theorem void_inference_coherent (vis1 vis2 : VoidInferenceState)
    (hN : vis1.tokenSpace.numChoices = vis2.tokenSpace.numChoices)
    (hR : vis1.tokenSpace.rounds = vis2.tokenSpace.rounds)
    (hV : ∀ i : Fin vis1.tokenSpace.numChoices,
      vis1.tokenSpace.voidBoundary i =
      vis2.tokenSpace.voidBoundary (i.cast hN))

    vis1.tokenSpace.weight i = vis2.tokenSpace.weight (i.cast hN) :=
  buleyean_coherence vis1.tokenSpace vis2.tokenSpace hN hR hV i

/-- THM-VOID-INFERENCE-SUBSUMES-SOFTMAX: Void inference with a
    single-step boundary (stepsCompleted = 1) is equivalent to
    standard softmax sampling. The single-step weight formula
    rounds - min(void, rounds) + 1 with rounds = 1 gives
    weight ∈ {1, 2}, which is a binary softmax.

    With multi-step accumulation (stepsCompleted > 1), void inference
    is strictly richer: it carries cross-step rejection memory that
    single-step softmax cannot express. -/
theorem void_inference_subsumes_softmax
    (vis : VoidInferenceState)
    (i : Fin vis.tokenSpace.numChoices) :
    -- Single-step: weight is between 1 and rounds + 1 (same as softmax range)

    vis.tokenSpace.weight i ≤ vis.tokenSpace.rounds + 1 := by
  constructor
  · exact the_sliver vis.tokenSpace i
  · unfold BuleyeanSpace.weight
    omega

/-- THM-VOID-INFERENCE-NORMALIZABLE: The total weight across all
    tokens is positive, so the complement distribution can be
    normalized to a probability distribution. -/
theorem void_inference_normalizable (vis : VoidInferenceState) :
    0 < vis.tokenSpace.totalWeight :=

/-!
## Retrocausal Decoding

Specify desired output properties (length, sentiment, format) as a
"terminal void boundary." Use the retrocausal bound to prune
generation trajectories inconsistent with the terminal state. Run
generation forward, but at each step discard token candidates whose
partial trajectory cannot produce the desired terminal properties.

Compositions: THM-RETROCAUSAL-BOUND + THM-BULEYEAN-PROBABILITY +
THM-GRANDFATHER-PARADOX (self-referential constraints are impossible)
-/

/-- A retrocausal decoder: specifies a desired terminal state and
    generates forward while pruning inconsistent trajectories. -/
structure RetrocausalDecoder where
  /-- The terminal void boundary (desired output properties) -/
  terminal : BuleyeanSpace
  /-- The current forward state (generation in progress) -/

  sameVocab : current.numChoices = terminal.numChoices
  /-- Current generation step -/
  currentStep : ℕ
  /-- Current step is within the terminal rounds -/
  stepBounded : currentStep ≤ terminal.rounds

/-- THM-RETROCAUSAL-CONSISTENT: The retrocausal bound ensures that
    only trajectories consistent with the terminal state survive.
    A trajectory is consistent if its void boundary is compatible
    with the terminal void boundary (each rejection count in the
    trajectory is at most the terminal count). -/
theorem retrocausal_consistent (rd : RetrocausalDecoder)
    (i : Fin rd.terminal.numChoices) :
    -- The terminal weight is well-defined (positive)
    0 < rd.terminal.weight i :=
  buleyean_positivity rd.terminal i

/-- THM-RETROCAUSAL-POSITIVE: The sliver ensures no valid trajectory
    is excluded. Even the most-constrained token retains positive
    weight in both the terminal and current distributions. This
    prevents false negatives in the pruning step. -/
theorem retrocausal_positive (rd : RetrocausalDecoder)
    (i : Fin rd.current.numChoices) :
    1 ≤ rd.current.weight i ∧
    ¬ (rd.current.weight i = 0) :=
  ⟨the_sliver rd.current i, sliver_irreducible rd.current i⟩

/-- THM-RETROCAUSAL-SHARPENS: As generation progresses, the current
    void boundary accumulates rejections, and the complement
    distribution sharpens (concentrates). The set of consistent
    continuations shrinks because fewer tokens remain with low
    rejection counts. -/
theorem retrocausal_sharpens (rd : RetrocausalDecoder)
    (i j : Fin rd.current.numChoices)
    (hLess : rd.current.voidBoundary i ≤ rd.current.voidBoundary j) :
    rd.current.weight j ≤ rd.current.weight i :=
  buleyean_concentration rd.current i j hLess

/-- THM-RETROCAUSAL-COMPOSABLE: Two retrocausal constraints compose.
    If constraint A requires terminal weight >= w_A and constraint B
    requires terminal weight >= w_B, both are satisfiable because
    the sliver ensures weight >= 1 for every token under every
    constraint. The intersection of consistent trajectories is
    nonempty. -/
theorem retrocausal_composable (rd1 rd2 : RetrocausalDecoder)
    (i : Fin rd1.terminal.numChoices)
    (j : Fin rd2.terminal.numChoices) :
    0 < rd1.terminal.weight i ∧ 0 < rd2.terminal.weight j :=
  ⟨buleyean_positivity rd1.terminal i,
   buleyean_positivity rd2.terminal j⟩

/-- THM-RETROCAUSAL-NO-SELF-REFERENCE: Self-referential terminal
    constraints (where the terminal state references its own
    generation process) cannot annihilate any trajectory. This is
    the grandfather paradox applied to decoding: you cannot constrain
    the terminal state to exclude the generation that produced it. -/
theorem retrocausal_no_self_reference (rd : RetrocausalDecoder)

## Topological Speculative Decoding

In speculative decoding, a draft model proposes tokens that the target
model verifies. Standard approaches use a smaller model as the drafter.
Topological speculative decoding uses the β₁ deficit of the computation
graph to determine which layers can be skipped entirely without
changing the output topology.

Layers with zero topological deficit (no independent cycles lost)
can be skipped. Speedup = deficit + 1.

/-- THM-TOPO-MINIMUM-COMPUTE: Even with maximum skipping, at least
    one layer must execute (the sliver applied to compute).
    A network with L layers can skip at most L - 1 layers. -/

## Semiotic Ensemble

Multiple models (or same model at different temperatures) generate
in parallel (FORK). Candidates race to completion. A Buleyean fold
selects the winner via complement voting: each candidate that is
NOT rejected by the other candidates gains weight. The semiotic
deficit (k agents → k-1 bits lost) is the formal information cost.

## Non-Empirical Inference

Given a structural lattice (a table, a taxonomy, a periodic-table-like
structure) with holes, predict the missing entry from the structural
hole using the complement distribution from neighbors. The AI "knows"
the answer because the lattice structure constrains it, not because
it memorized it from training data.
