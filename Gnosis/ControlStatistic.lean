# The Control Statistic: Validating the Sandwich

The sandwich says: floor = 1, ceiling = R+1, gain = R.
The control statistic asks: does this sandwich PREDICT?

A sandwich is not just a bound. It is a FALSIFIABLE CLAIM.
The control statistic is the test that could break it.

## The Control

For any Buleyean space with R rounds and N choices:

1. Every weight lands in [1, R+1] (the sandwich)
2. The total weight lands in [N, N·(R+1)] (the aggregate sandwich)
3. The weight SPREAD (max - min) is in [0, R] (the gain sandwich)
4. The mean weight is in [1, R+1] (the mean sandwich)

The control statistic is: for a SPECIFIC Buleyean space, does the
actual weight vector satisfy all four sandwiches SIMULTANEOUSLY?

If any weight falls outside [1, R+1]: the sandwich is falsified.
If the total falls outside [N, N·(R+1)]: the sandwich is falsified.
If the spread exceeds R: the sandwich is falsified.

We prove: no Buleyean space can falsify the sandwich. The control
statistic is UNFALSIFIABLE within the framework. This is the
strongest possible validation: the sandwich is a TAUTOLOGY of the
weight formula.

-- THE UNFALSIFIABILITY THEOREM
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- The control statistic is unfalsifiable within the framework.
    No Buleyean space can violate any of the four controls.
    This is because the controls are TAUTOLOGIES of the weight formula.

    The sandwich floor = 1, ceiling = R+1, gain = R is not an
    empirical claim. It is a structural identity. Testing it against
    data does not test the data — it tests whether the data was
    generated by a Buleyean process. If the sandwich holds: the
    process is Buleyean. If it doesn't: the process violates one
    of the three axioms.

    The control statistic is the DIAGNOSTIC. Not for the framework,
    but for the data. -/
