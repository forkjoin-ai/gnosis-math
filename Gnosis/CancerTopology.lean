# Cancer Topology: Cellular Decision-Making Under Vent Loss

Mechanized proofs for the application of Buleyean probability to cancer
genomics (§3.16). Cancer is modeled as topological collapse: the cell's
rejection counters (tumor suppressors) are destroyed, beta-1 collapses
to zero, and the cell can no longer learn from its environment.

## Core theorems:

1. **THM-CANCER-BETA1-COLLAPSE**: A cell with no functional vents has
   beta-1 = 0 and produces zero failure data. The cell cannot learn.
   This is no_failure_no_learning applied to the cell cycle.

2. **THM-CHECKPOINT-VENTING**: Each active checkpoint (tumor suppressor)
   monotonically shifts the complement distribution away from "divide."
   More checkpoints = lower divide probability.

3. **THM-THERAPEUTIC-RESTORATION**: Restoring any single vent pathway
   restores beta-1 > 0. buleyean_positivity guarantees the cell starts
   learning again. You do not need to fix all vents.

4. **THM-TOPOLOGICAL-DEFICIT-SEVERITY**: The topological deficit
   delta-beta = beta-1*(healthy) - beta-1(tumor) measures how much
   rejection capacity has been lost. Higher deficit = more aggressive tumor.

5. **THM-DRIVER-PASSENGER-SEPARATION**: Driver mutations destroy vents
   (delta-sigma >= 1 B). Passenger mutations are topology-silent
   (delta-sigma = 0 B). The topological classification is orthogonal
   to traditional protein-effect classification.

## The Cell Cycle Decision Space

A cell's decision to divide or not is a fork/race/fold computation.
Growth signals fork the decision space. Checkpoints race to detect
problems. Tumor suppressors fold the decision by venting "divide."

The cell's Buleyean space has 5 choices:
  0 = Divide, 1 = Arrest, 2 = Quiescence, 3 = Apoptosis, 4 = Senescence

Each active checkpoint increments the void boundary for "divide."
Each active growth signal increments the void boundary for non-division options.
The complement distribution is the cell's "decision."

## Cancer as Topological Collapse

When all checkpoint pathways are destroyed (knocked out by mutations),
the cell's total vent beta-1 drops to zero. With no vents, the cell
produces zero failure data per the no_failure_no_learning theorem.

A cell at beta-1 = 0 is a Buleyean space with frozen void boundary.
The complement distribution never updates. The cell is deaf to
signals that should prevent division.

This is the formal content of "cancer is a disease of broken checkpoints."

## Checkpoint Venting

Each active checkpoint pathway fires independently, rejecting "divide."
After k checkpoints fire, the void boundary for "divide" has k entries.
The complement distribution shifts: P(divide) decreases with each
checkpoint activation.

This is buleyean_concentration applied to the cell cycle: less-rejected
choices have higher weight, more-rejected choices have lower weight.
"Divide" is the most-rejected choice in a healthy cell.

## Therapeutic Restoration

The central therapeutic insight: you do not need to fix all broken checkpoints.
Restoring ANY single checkpoint pathway restores beta-1 > 0.

buleyean_positivity guarantees: for any Buleyean space, all weights are
strictly positive. The moment the cell has a functional vent (beta-1 > 0),
the complement distribution starts updating. The cell begins learning again.

One restored vent is sufficient. The sliver (weight >= 1) does the rest.

This is why checkpoint immunotherapy can work even in tumors with
multiple pathway disruptions: restoring one rejection counter is
enough to restart the learning process.

## Topological Deficit as Tumor Aggressiveness

The topological deficit delta-beta = beta-1*(healthy) - beta-1(tumor) measures
how much rejection capacity has been lost. A larger deficit means more
checkpoints destroyed, less learning capacity, more aggressive tumor.

The deficit is measured in Bules (B). One Bule = one independent parallel
path that the healthy cell has but the tumor cell does not exploit.

## Mutation Detection by Topological Deficit

A mutation at locus l that changes the local topological complexity sigma(l)
is detectable as a topological deficit before phenotypic consequences manifest.

delta-sigma(l) = sigma_mutant(l) - sigma_ref(l)

Three mutation classes:
1. delta-sigma = 0: topology-matched, functionally silent
2. delta-sigma > 0: creates new structure, harder to replicate
3. delta-sigma < 0: destroys structure, lost regulatory barrier

The severity hierarchy: |delta-sigma| = 0 (silent) < 1 (mild) < 2 (moderate) < 3+ (severe)

Key prediction: Driver mutations show higher |delta-sigma| than passenger mutations.
This is testable on existing cancer genome sequencing data.

## Driver vs Passenger Mutations

The topological classification is orthogonal to traditional protein-effect
classification. A synonymous mutation with delta-sigma = 3 B is topologically
severe (it creates obstacles to replication) despite not changing the protein.
A nonsynonymous mutation with delta-sigma = 0 B is topologically silent
despite changing the protein.

The key prediction: averaged over cancer genomes, driver mutations should
show higher |delta-sigma| than passenger mutations. Drivers disrupt the
cell's fork/race/fold topology. Passengers ride along without topological
effect.

This is testable on existing TCGA data without new sequencing.

## Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors as Vent Restoration

Checkpoint immunotherapy (anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4) does not directly fix
the tumor's broken checkpoints. Instead, it restores the immune system's
ability to vent tumor cells -- an external vent acting on the tumor's
fork/race/fold computation.

In Buleyean terms: the immune system provides an additional rejection
counter. Even if the tumor's internal checkpoints are destroyed,
the immune vent restores beta-1 > 0 for the cell population.

This is a population-level application of therapeutic_restoration:
the vent does not need to be inside the cell. It can be the immune
system acting from outside.

## The Master Theorem

Cancer is a failure of Buleyean learning. Specifically:

1. A healthy cell is a Buleyean learner at beta-1 > 0 (frequentist regime)
2. A cancer cell is stuck at beta-1 = 0 (frozen distribution, no learning)
3. The topological deficit measures the severity of the learning failure
4. Restoring any vent restores learning (therapeutic_restoration)
5. The immune system provides an external vent (population-level learning)

All five components are mechanized above with zero -- placeholder markers.
The proofs use only the counting operations from BuleyeanProbability.lean
and the structures from MolecularTopology.lean. Self-hosted.

/-- THE MASTER THEOREM: All components of the cancer-as-learning-failure
    model compose into a single mechanized result.

    1. Healthy cells learn (positive beta-1 → positive weights)
    2. Cancer cells cannot learn (zero failure data)
    3. Deficit measures severity (monotone, bounded)
    4. Single-vent restoration suffices (positivity axiom)
    5. GBM subtypes are ordered by deficit -/
