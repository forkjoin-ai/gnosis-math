  =================

  The twin paradox on the light-cone lattice, continuing the time / time-travel
  thread (`InformationLightCone`, `TimeTravelLightCone`).

  A worldline assigns a spatial position to each integer tick. The same
  speed-of-light constraint as `InformationLightCone` (`|Δx| ≤ 1` per tick)
  governs it. PROPER TIME along a worldline is the number of REST steps
  (`x(t+1) = x(t)`): a light-speed step (`|Δx| = 1`) is lightlike and carries no
  proper time, the discrete shadow of `dτ = √(dt² − dr²) = 0` on the cone.

  Consequences, all proved:
    * `properTime_le`      — proper time never exceeds coordinate time
                             (the rest frame maximizes aging).
    * `home_twin`          — the resting twin's proper time equals `N`.
    * `proper_time_lt_of_motion` — any spatial motion strictly reduces aging.
    * `twin_paradox`       — a twin that leaves the origin and returns ages
                             STRICTLY less than the one who stayed.

  Init-only. Zero `sorry`, zero new `axiom`.
