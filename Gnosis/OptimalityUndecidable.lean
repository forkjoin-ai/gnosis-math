# Compiler Optimality Is Undecidable -- But Local Optimality Is Provable

Can we prove we have reached the optimal compiler? No. And the impossibility
is itself a theorem.

Global optimality ("no faster compiler exists that produces the same output")
requires enumerating all possible compilers and comparing their performance.
This is at least as hard as the halting problem: given a candidate compiler C',
determining whether C' halts on input S and produces the correct output is
undecidable. Therefore, "C is globally optimal" is undecidable.

But three weaker forms of optimality ARE provable:

1. Bootstrap optimality: the compiler has converged to its own fixed point.
   Deficit = 0. No further self-iteration improves performance.

2. Pareto optimality: no other compiler in the family dominates on both
   speed and verification depth simultaneously.

3. Local optimality: the cost sequence has stabilized. No single-step
   mutation in the current landscape improves performance.

These three together are the best you can do. And they are exactly what the
compiler family benchmark shows. The void boundary is the sufficient statistic:
you cannot prove you have found everything, but you can prove that what you
have found is consistent with everything you have rejected.
