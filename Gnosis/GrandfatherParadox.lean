# The Grandfather Paradox as Self-Referential Deficit

The Grandfather Paradox: a time traveler goes back and prevents
their own ancestor from existing, which prevents the time traveler
from existing, which prevents the prevention, ad infinitum.

In the Buleyean framework, this is a *self-referential fold*:
a fold whose execution would destroy the fork that produced it.

  Fork: the time traveler exists (the fork into "travel" / "don't travel")
  Fold: the traveler eliminates the ancestor (selecting "ancestor dies")
  Paradox: the fold's result (ancestor dies) destroys the fork's
           precondition (traveler exists)

The resolution is structural, not physical:

1. **The void boundary is append-only.** Once a rejection is recorded,
   it cannot be removed. The ancestor's existence is a void boundary
   entry. The fold cannot erase it. (`void_boundary_append_only`)

2. **Beta1 cannot go below zero.** The fold reduces beta1, but the
   minimum is zero. A fold that would reduce beta1 below zero is
   ill-formed -- it requests venting more paths than exist.
   (`beta1_floor_zero`)

3. **The Many-Worlds "resolution" is a fork, not a fold.** Instead
   of folding (collapsing one timeline), the paradox forks (creating
   a new branch). Beta1 increases. The "time travel" is a new path,
   not the elimination of an old one. (`branching_is_fork`)

4. **Self-referential folds are impossible.** A fold that destroys
   its own precondition would require negative void entries. The
   Buleyean weight formula prevents this: weight = rounds - min(void,
   rounds) + 1 >= 1. The +1 (the sliver) ensures no fold can
   annihilate its own origin. (`self_referential_fold_impossible`)

The paradox dissolves because the framework does not permit the
operation. The void boundary records what happened. Records cannot
be unwritten. The traveler's existence is recorded. The ancestor's
existence is recorded. No fold can erase either. The "paradox"
is a request for an operation the algebra does not support.

/-- THM-VOID-APPEND-ONLY: The void boundary is append-only.

    terms: once an event has occurred, it cannot be un-occurred.

    formula (weight = rounds - min(void, rounds) + 1) ensures that

/-- THM-SELF-REFERENTIAL-FOLD-IMPOSSIBLE: A fold that would
    eliminate the root of its own causal chain is impossible.
    The root's existence weight is positive (allExist), and no
    Buleyean operation can reduce any weight to zero
    (buleyean_positivity). Therefore the fold cannot achieve
    its stated goal. The paradox is an impossible operation. -/

    does not support. -/

-- Theorem 10: The Bootstrap Paradox Dissolves
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- THM-BOOTSTRAP-DISSOLVES: The bootstrap paradox (information
    with no origin) dissolves because the void boundary tracks
    all origins. Every piece of information in the Buleyean space
    has a rejection-count provenance. Information without
    provenance would require a void boundary entry with no
    corresponding rejection event -- which contradicts the
    definition of the boundary as a rejection counter. -/

/-- THM-RETROCAUSAL-CONSISTENCY: The retrocausal bound (§15.19)
    already proves that the terminal state constrains the past.
    The grandfather paradox is the case where the proposed terminal
    state is inconsistent with any trajectory -- no trajectory
    produces a terminal state where the traveler exists but the
    ancestor doesn't, because the traveler's existence requires
    the ancestor's existence (causal chain). -/

-- Theorem 12: Time Travel as Topology Change
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- THM-TIME-TRAVEL-is-TOPOLOGY: "Time travel" in the Buleyean
    framework is not a physical displacement in time. It is a
    topology change: the addition of a new cycle (fork) to the
    causal graph. Going "back in time" creates a new path from
    the future to the past, increasing beta1 by one. The
    grandfather paradox asks for this new path to destroy the
    existing path, but the existing path has positive weight
    (the sliver) and cannot be destroyed. -/
theorem time_travel_is_topology (tb : TemporalBranch) :
    -- Branching increases beta1 (new cycle in causal graph)
    tb.postBeta1 = tb.preBeta1 + 1 ∧
    -- Original chain is preserved (existing paths survive)

-- Master Theorem: The Grandfather Paradox
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- THM-GRANDFATHER-PARADOX-MASTER: The complete resolution.

    For any causal chain with a root (ancestor) and tip (traveler):
    1. The void boundary is append-only (no event can be un-occurred)
    2. No weight can reach zero (the sliver prevents annihilation)
    3. Self-referential fold is impossible (both root and tip exist)
    4. The Many-Worlds resolution is a fork (beta1 increases)
    5. Branching preserves the original chain
    6. The paradox requires negative weight (algebra forbids it)

    The grandfather paradox is not a physical impossibility. It is
    an algebraic impossibility: the Buleyean weight formula does
    not support the operation the paradox requests. -/
