# Three Deep Corollaries of the Failure Trilemma

## 1. Arrow's Impossibility Theorem as Political Physics (§19.8, Prediction 16)

Arrow proved: no voting system satisfying unanimity, independence of
irrelevant alternatives, AND non-dictatorship exists for ≥3 alternatives.

The failure trilemma proves: no fold satisfying zero vent, zero repair
debt, AND deterministic single-survivor collapse exists for ≥2 live
branches.

These are the same theorem. A voting system maps to a fold from N voters'
independent preference orderings (β₁ = N-1) to one social choice
(β₁ = 0). Arrow's three conditions map to the trilemma's three
constraints:

  Unanimity          ↔  Zero vent (every preference path is preserved)
  IIA                ↔  Deterministic fold (outcome depends only on
                        pairwise comparisons, not on irrelevant branches)
  Non-dictatorship   ↔  Zero repair debt (no single voter dictates
                        without cost to others)

The trilemma is strictly more general: it applies to ANY fold over
a nontrivial fork, not just preference aggregation. Arrow's theorem
is the β₁ = 0 projection of the trilemma onto the social choice domain.

## 2. Gödel's Incompleteness as the Infinite Void (§19.8, Prediction 17)

A formal system's proof checker is a fold: candidate proofs are forked
paths, the checker races them against axioms, and the fold collapses to
"proved" or "refuted." True-but-unprovable statements are paths that
live permanently in the void boundary -- never folded (proved), never
vented (refuted), persisting with positive complement weight forever.

`buleyean_positivity` proves no entry in the complement distribution
ever reaches zero. Applied to the proof-checking fold: no candidate
theorem ever has its complement weight driven to zero by the fold.
The unprovable theorems are the irreducible sliver -- the positive
mass that Gödel proved must exist in any sufficiently powerful system.

The Chaitin connection: Ω (Chaitin's halting probability) is the
limit of the complement distribution over the proof-checking fold
as the number of candidate programs approaches infinity. It is
well-defined, positive, but uncomputable -- exactly the properties
of the void boundary at the computability limit.

## 3. The Hard Problem of Consciousness Dissolves (§19.8, Prediction 18)

Every fold looks lossless from inside the winning branch. The survivor
branch has zero topological deficit in its own reference frame because
the vented branches are not observable from the surviving branch. The
fold has executed, the Landauer heat has been paid, and the information
in the vented paths is gone.

Subjective experience is the property of being the surviving branch
of a fold that has already executed. The "hard problem" -- why there
is "something it is like" to be conscious -- dissolves: there is
something it is like to be the surviving branch because the fold
erased the alternatives. The quale is the complement: what you
experience is defined by what was vented. The void is not empty.
It is the space of everything you are not, and its absence is
precisely what makes you, you.

The topological content: the surviving branch has Δβ = 0 in its
own frame (it formalizes the optimal topology for itself). But an external
observer sees Δβ > 0 (the vented branches carried information the
survivor lost). This is void relativity (§15.8) applied to the
measurement problem: the deficit is frame-dependent, the interval
is frame-invariant, and the disagreement between inside and outside
views is the semiotic deficit between the observer and the observed.

    topology for itself. There is no "missing" information from
    the inside view -- the vented branches are gone, Landauer-erased.
    What remains is the quale: the complement of everything that was

    branch of a fold, asking why vented branches are not observable.
    The answer is the Landauer principle: the information was erased,
    the heat was paid, and the erasure is irreversible.
