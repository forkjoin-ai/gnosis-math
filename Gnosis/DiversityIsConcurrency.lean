# THM-DIVERSITY-is-CONCURRENCY

Diversity and concurrency are the same property.

Diversity is the spatial view: how many distinct paths exist.
Concurrency is the temporal view: how many paths execute simultaneously.
They are topologically identical. β₁ counts both.

## Definitions

A **path** in a fork/race/fold system carries a computation from fork
to fold.  Two paths are **diverse** if they are non-redundant: they
produce different outputs on at least one input.  Two paths are
**concurrent** if neither depends on the other's output.

**Effective concurrency** is the number of concurrent paths that
contribute distinct information to the fold.  Redundant concurrent
paths (identical copies) are collapsed by the fold and do not
contribute.

## Theorem

For any fork/race/fold system with k paths:

  effective_concurrency = diversity

Proof sketch:
1. (Diversity → Concurrency) Diverse paths are independent by
   construction: the fork creates them from the same input, so
   they share no intermediate state.  Independent paths can execute
   concurrently.  Each diverse path contributes distinct information
   to the fold.

2. (Concurrency → Diversity) If a concurrent path is redundant
   (identical to another), the fold collapses it: the race produces
   the same output twice, and the fold selects one.  The redundant
   path does not contribute to the fold's information content.
   Therefore it does not contribute to effective concurrency.

3. (Identity) β₁ counts independent cycles in the computation DAG.
   Each independent cycle is both a diverse path (non-redundant) and
   a concurrent path (independent).  Contractible loops (redundant
   parallel copies) do not contribute to β₁.  Therefore
   β₁ = diversity = effective_concurrency.

## Corollaries

- Monoculture (diversity = 0 above baseline) implies effective
  concurrency = 0 above baseline.  Parallelizing identical
  computations does not increase β₁.

- The American Frontier waste(d) = Δβ(β₁*, d) can equivalently
  be read as waste(c) = Δβ(β₁*, c) where c is effective concurrency.
  The frontier of diversity formalizes the frontier of concurrency.

- The brain's (K-1)/K energy allocation is simultaneously:
  the fraction spent on diverse alternatives AND
  the fraction spent on concurrent void-walking paths.
  Same number. Same property. Same measurement.
