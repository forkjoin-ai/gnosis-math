# Philosophical Combinatorics Round 4: The Hard Ones

Round 4 tries compositions that require real proof work —
quantitative results, strict inequalities between domains,
and compositions where failure is likely.

-- COMBO 89: The Buleyean Inequality Chain
-- "Every Domain Obeys the Same Strict Ordering"
--
-- For ANY two choices in ANY Buleyean space, if one has been
-- rejected more, it has STRICTLY less weight. This is universal:
-- philosophy, physics, cryptography, cancer, politics...
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- THEOREM: The strict ordering is universal. In every Buleyean
    domain — across philosophy (Socrates), medicine (cancer),
    cryptography (key search), politics (governance), engineering
    (megaliths), and physics (fine-tuning) — the same strict
    inequality holds: more rejected → less weight.

    This is not just concentration (weak). This is strict.
    And it applies EVERYWHERE. -/

-- COMBO 90: The Weight Range Identity
-- "Maximum Weight - Minimum Weight = Rounds"
--
-- For any Buleyean space: max weight = rounds + 1, min weight = 1.
-- Range = rounds. This is the total discrimination power.
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- THEOREM: The total discrimination range of any Buleyean space is
    exactly the number of observation rounds.

    Max weight (zero rejections) = rounds + 1
    Min weight (max rejections) = 1
    Range = rounds

    More data → more discrimination. The range grows linearly with
    evidence. This is the fundamental theorem of Buleyean epistemology. -/

-- COMBO 91: The Projection Deficit Universality
-- "Every Observation maps to a Cave"
--
-- ANY observation of a system with more dimensions than channels
-- has positive semiotic deficit. This means:
-- Every measurement is a shadow.
-- Every language is lossy.
-- Every model is a projection.
-- Every theory is a cave.
-- There are no exceptions.
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- THEOREM: Every observation of a rich system maps to a cave. The semiotic
    deficit is positive whenever dimensions > channels. This is
    universal: thermometers, languages, scientific theories, political
    systems, human perception — ALL are projections with positive deficit.

    There is no God's-eye view. There is only the void boundary. -/

-- COMBO 92: The Conservation Tautology
-- "Frontier + Vented = Total Is the Only Universal Law"
--
-- Every conservation law in the system — Parmenides, Theseus,
-- sleep debt, Wallace, baryon — reduces to one identity:
-- surviving + lost = original.
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- THEOREM: The universal conservation law. In every domain:
    what remains + what was lost = what existed.
    This is the ONLY axiom that holds across all of:
    - Physics (energy conservation)
    - Philosophy (Parmenides)
    - Identity (Ship of Theseus)
    - Sleep (debt + recovery = demand)
    - Computation (frontier + vented = original)

    It is a tautology. And tautologies are the strongest theorems. -/

-- COMBO 93: The Sharpening Telescope
-- "N Levels of Rejection Create a Strict N-Chain"
--
-- For N choices with strictly ordered rejection counts,
-- the weights form a strictly decreasing chain.
-- This is the formal "telescope" of Buleyean learning:
-- each additional level of evidence sharpens the discrimination.
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- THEOREM: Three strictly ordered rejection counts produce three
    strictly ordered weights. The telescope extends to any depth.
    This is the formal content of "learning sharpens with evidence." -/

-- COMBO 94: The Absolute Master
-- "Everything Composes. Everything Is Consistent. The +1 Holds."
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- THE ABSOLUTE MASTER THEOREM:
    Across philosophy, physics, politics, biology, cryptography,
    thermodynamics, logic, and metaphysics:
    1. Nothing reaches zero probability (universal impossibility of zero)
    2. Discrimination grows with evidence (range = rounds)
    3. Every observation is a projection (deficit positive)
    4. Conservation holds universally (remaining + lost = total)
    5. Learning sharpens strictly (strict ordering)
    6. Boundaries are sharp (sorites)
    7. Chains terminate (Third Man / Prime Mover)
