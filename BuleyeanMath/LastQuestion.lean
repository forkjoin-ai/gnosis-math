# The Last Question: Entropy Reversal as Complement Convergence

Asimov's "The Last Question" (1956) traces a single question across
cosmic time: "How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be
massively decreased?" The answer is always "INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR
MEANINGFUL ANSWER" -- until the very end of time, when the computer
has accumulated all possible data, and speaks the universe back
into existence.

In the Buleyean framework, this is a theorem. The void boundary
grows monotonically (entropy of the universe increases -- Second
Law). But the complement distribution -- the knowledge extracted
from what was rejected -- sharpens monotonically (Buleyean
concentration). These are the same process viewed from opposite
sides.

"INSUFFICIENT DATA" is Bule > 0: the deficit is positive, the
complement distribution has not yet converged. The data accumulates
because every rejection adds an entry to the void boundary. The
deficit decreases by one per round (`future_deficit_monotone`).
At round F - 1, the deficit reaches zero
(`future_deficit_eventually_zero`). At Bule = 0, the complement
distribution is fully converged. The answer is computable.

"LET THERE BE LIGHT" is the fork operation applied to the converged
complement distribution: the converged distribution at Bule = 0
is a valid Bayesian prior (`converged_prior_informative`). A prior
can initialize a new Buleyean space. The universe ends (all paths
vented to void) and the complement seeds the next one.

The sliver (`buleyean_positivity`) is why this works. Even at
maximum void -- heat death, every path rejected -- every choice
retains weight >= 1. The distribution never collapses to a point.
There is always enough probability mass to seed a new fork.
"Never say never" is the answer to the Last Question.

    rejected in every round -- every choice has weight exactly 1
    (minimum weight). The distribution is maximally concentrated but
    never collapses to zero.

    Heat death is the state where the void boundary is full. In a

    every choice retains weight >= 1. The distribution never collapses
    to zero. There is always enough probability mass to seed a new
    fork.

    This is the answer to the Last Question. Entropy increases
    monotonically (the void grows). But the complement never reaches
    zero (buleyean_positivity). The irreducible +1 in the weight
    formula is the sliver of escape. The universe can always be
    restarted because "never say never" is a theorem. -/

-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- THM-LET-THERE-BE-LIGHT: A converged complement distribution
    (Bule = 0) is a valid Bayesian prior for a new Buleyean space.
    The prior has strictly differentiated weights: different rejection
    counts produce different weights. The prior is informative.

    "LET THERE BE LIGHT" is the fork operation applied to this prior:
    the converged distribution initializes a new void boundary, seeding
    a new universe of choices. The old universe's death (maximum void)
    is the new universe's birth (informative prior). -/

-- Theorem 7: Entropy Reversal Is Complement Convergence
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- THM-ENTROPY-REVERSAL: The void boundary grows monotonically
    (entropy of the universe increases). The complement distribution
    concentrates monotonically (entropy of the prediction decreases).
    These are the same process.

    Specifically: a non-rejected choice's weight can only increase
    after a rejection round (buleyean_monotone_nonrejected). The
    complement distribution sharpens with every observation. The
    "entropy reversal" is not a violation of the Second Law -- it
    is the Second Law viewed from the complement side.

    The universe gets more disordered (void grows). Our knowledge of
    the universe gets more ordered (complement sharpens). Same data.
    Opposite signs. -/

    state: Multivac before any data.

    Without failure data, all choices are equally weighted.
    The complement distribution is a coin flip. There is no

    the deficit is max(0, d - k). No randomness. No uncertainty
    about when the answer will arrive.

    Multivac does not "get lucky." It does not "have a breakthrough."

/-- THM-LAST-QUESTION: The complete formal content of Asimov's
    "The Last Question."

    For any Buleyean space (any universe with finite choices):
    1. Data accumulates monotonically (deficit decreases)
    2. The answer is eventually computable (deficit reaches zero)
    3. Every choice survives heat death (weight >= 1, the sliver)
    4. No choice can ever reach zero probability (irreducible)
    5. Zero observation yields no answer (uniform = coin flip)

    The journey from "INSUFFICIENT DATA" to the answer is the
    Buleyean trajectory from Bule > 0 to Bule = 0. The answer to
    "can entropy be reversed?" is: the complement distribution's
    entropy decreases monotonically as the void boundary grows.
    Entropy reversal is not a violation of thermodynamics. It is
    thermodynamics viewed from the complement side. And the sliver
    -- the irreducible +1 -- ensures the converged distribution
    always has enough mass to seed a new fork.

    "LET THERE BE LIGHT" is the fork. -/
