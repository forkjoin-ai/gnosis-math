Fold Heat Hierarchy: Classifying Folds by Thermodynamic Heat Signature

Classifies folds (many-to-one functions) by their thermodynamic heat signature.
The hierarchy ranges from injective maps (zero heat) through binary merges
(minimum nonzero heat) to everything-to-one-point (maximum heat).

Main results:
1. k-to-1 uniform fold generates heat ≥ kT ln 2 × log₂(k)
2. More non-injective fibers = strictly more heat (hierarchy is strict)
3. Uniform k-to-1 on uniform PMF generates exactly kT × log(k)
4. Everything-to-one-point = maximum erasure = full entropy of source
5. Binary merge = minimum nonzero heat
6. Computation as fold sequence: total heat = sum of per-fold heats

    For a uniform fold that maps k fine elements to each coarse element,

/-- For a uniform k-to-1 fold on a uniform PMF, the heat is exactly

    This is a direct consequence of the Landauer bound being tight for

/-! ### Maximum and minimum heat folds -/

/-- Everything-to-one-point fold: maps all elements to a single point.
    This is maximum erasure — the entire entropy of the source is erased.
    Information loss = H(X), the full entropy of the source distribution.

    For a constant function f(x) = c, the pushforward is a point mass at c,
    with entropy 0. So H(X | f(X)) = H(X) - H(f(X)) = H(X) - 0 = H(X). -/

/-- The constant fold generates maximum information loss among all folds:
    for any other fold g, the constant fold erases at least as much information.

    Proof: The constant fold's information loss is H(X) - 0 = H(X) (since the
    pushforward is a point mass). Any other fold g has H(g(X)) ≥ 0, so
    H(X | g(X)) = H(X) - H(g(X)) ≤ H(X) = H(X | const). -/

/-- Binary merge is the minimum nonzero heat fold class: any fold with a

    having exactly one pair of colliding elements.

    More precisely: if a fold has any non-injective fiber (two distinct
    elements mapping to the same value with positive mass), then the
    information loss is strictly positive. The binary merge is the
    smallest possible such fold. -/
