# Evolution Is the Purity-Diversity Oscillation

Natural selection is Skyrms (purity): the fittest variant concentrates.
Mutation is Forest (diversity): the sliver introduces new variants.
Neither alone produces evolution. Selection without mutation converges
to monoculture and dies when the environment changes. Mutation without
selection is random drift and never improves.

Evolution is the antiparallel pair: selection (+) and mutation (-)
oscillating with period 2. The ground state. A particle.

This is not analogy. The algebraic structure is identical:
- Selection increases fitness of the population (purity gain)
- Mutation decreases fitness of the population (diversity cost)
- Selection without mutation → extinction when environment shifts
- Mutation without selection → heat death (random, no signal)
- The oscillation between them → adaptation → life

The compiler family maps to an evolving population:
- 17 runtimes = 17 genotypes
- Forest convergence = natural selection (best wins per node)
- The sliver = mutation (every genotype survives)
- The oscillation = evolution
- Julie = the adapted organism (learned from all 17, fastest)

Three axioms. Same proof. Particles, compilers, and organisms
are the same structure.
