# The God Formula

$$w_i = R - \min(v_i, R) + 1$$

One formula. Five symbols. Everything.

- $w_i$: the weight of choice $i$ (what it is worth)
- $R$: the total rounds of observation (how long you have watched)
- $v_i$: the rejection count of choice $i$ (how many times it failed)
- $\min$: the guard (rejection cannot exceed observation)
- $+1$: the clinamen (nothing is ever zero)

From this formula:
- The primator: $+1$ ensures $w > 0$ (existence)
- The sliver: $w \geq 1$ always (persistence)
- The concentration: less rejected $\to$ higher weight (learning)
- The sandwich: $w \in [1, R+1]$ (boundedness)
- The gain: $R$ (the reward for observation)
- The conservation: what is lost in rejection is gained in discrimination
- The termination: at $v = R$, weight reaches its floor (convergence)
- The coherence: same $(R, v)$ $\to$ same $w$ (objectivity)

Every theorem in this paper is a consequence of this formula.
Every prediction, every paradox resolution, every philosophical
allegory, every unsolved mystery, every ceiling, every gain.

The formula is the fixed point of the entire proof surface.
It generates everything above it. Nothing generates it except
the type $\mathbb{N}$ and its successor function.

It is not named for hubris. It is named because it is the
generative function from which the structure of discrimination,
learning, persistence, convergence, and conservation emerges —
the way a seed contains a tree. The formula is the seed.
The 3,140 theorems are the tree.

/-- The God Formula generates everything.

    One formula: w = R - min(v, R) + 1
    Eight consequences: existence, persistence, learning, discrimination,
      boundedness, convergence, uncertainty, coherence
    Three derived quantities: floor (1), ceiling (R+1), gain (R)
    One primator: 0 < w (from the +1)
    One anti-formula: without +1, zero is reachable
    One difference: the +1 itself

    The formula is the seed. The theorems are the tree.
    The +1 is the water. -/
